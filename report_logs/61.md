QUESTION:
Research on the price dynamics of chub mackerel in major aquatic markets of Pacific Rim countries, and its interannual variations in weight/length. Combined with oceanographic theory, these research findings can further establish direct correlations between high-quality marine biological resources, aquatic markets, fishery economics, and the marine environment.

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (6 total):
  #1: Identify major Pacific Rim chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus / S. colias where relevant) markets and price reporting systems (Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Russia Far East, US/Canada West Coast, Mexico, Chile/Peru), including product forms, auction/wholesale structures, units, seasonality, and any 2020–2026 regulatory, traceability, or trade changes that affect observed prices. Focus on sourcing from official market statistics, fishery agencies, and industry reports.
  #2: Compile available time-series data and empirical studies on chub mackerel prices in Pacific Rim markets (ideally 10–20+ years through 2025/early 2026). Look for evidence on nominal vs real price trends, exchange-rate impacts, quality/grade segmentation and size-based price premia, seasonality, volatility, and cross-market price transmission/cointegration (e.g., VAR/VECM, law-of-one-price tests).
  #3: Research interannual biological variation in chub mackerel size (weight/length, age/size-at-age, condition factor) across key Pacific Rim stocks (e.g., Northwest Pacific Japanese/Korean/Chinese stocks, California Current, Mexico, Chile/Peru if applicable). Identify datasets (surveys, port sampling, observer programs), major findings on drivers (cohort effects, recruitment, fishery selectivity), and documented links between oceanographic indices (ENSO, PDO, upwelling, SST, marine heatwaves) and growth/availability.
  #4: Fill key evidence gaps on chub mackerel market/price reporting systems and time series for: (a) Russia Far East (e.g., Vladivostok auctions, Rosrybolovstvo stats, Far Eastern fish exchanges), (b) US/Canada West Coast modern era (2000–2025) ex-vessel and wholesale prices for Pacific mackerel, (c) Mexico, and (d) Chile/Peru (often linked to jack mackerel but chub mackerel exists). Prioritize official/statistical sources and long time series (landings value/price, auction prices, wholesale/retail price indices).
  #5: Research empirical literature connecting mackerel (chub/Pacific) size/condition and prices/quality grades: evidence of size-based price premia in auctions/wholesale markets, how grading works (pcs/kg, fat %, freshness), and how market sorting can bias observed size distributions in landings. Include examples from Japan/Korea and any Pacific Americas cases.
  #6: Research integrated modeling approaches that link environment (ENSO/PDO/upwelling/SST/chl-a) → chub mackerel growth/size structure → catch timing/composition → prices and fishery economics. Find examples using state-space, SEM, Bayesian hierarchical panels, or VAR/VECM with exogenous climate indices, preferably applied to small pelagics or mackerel in Pacific Rim regions.

ANSWER:
## 0) Scope, species, and a critical naming caveat

- **Chub mackerel** in the Northwest Pacific is generally **_Scomber japonicus_** (“ma-saba” in Japan). In the U.S. context the same species is typically called **Pacific mackerel** and NOAA lists it as **_S. japonicus_**, also “chub mackerel” as an alternate name [[52]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-mackerel).  
- In parts of Latin America, the common name **“caballa”** is used broadly, and an official Peruvian technical sheet labels “caballa” as **_Scomber scombrus_** [[65]](https://www.producempresarial.pe/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/158-5.-Ficha-Recurso-Caballa_SET-2024.pdf) (Atlantic mackerel), which is **taxonomically inconsistent with the usual Pacific chub mackerel framing** and creates real risk of mixing species when compiling “caballa” market series across countries. For any “caballa” price/size analysis, you should verify **species codes** in the underlying landings/market datasets rather than relying on the common name alone [[65]](https://www.producempresarial.pe/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/158-5.-Ficha-Recurso-Caballa_SET-2024.pdf), [[52]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-mackerel).

Throughout, I focus on **price dynamics in major Pacific Rim aquatic markets** and **interannual variations in size (weight/length)**, and then connect them using **oceanographic theory** into an integrated environment → biology → catch/quality → market → price/bioeconomic framework. I also flag where the evidence base in the retrieved sources is strong vs where it remains incomplete.

## 1) Major aquatic markets & price-discovery institutions (Pacific Rim)

### Japan (Tokyo as reference hub; auctions; strong institutional structure)
**Key market institution:** Tokyo’s wholesale market system (formerly Tsukiji, now **Toyosu**). Toyosu is described as the world’s largest wholesale fish market, with **~1,400–1,700 tons/day** traded [[1]](https://www.toyosu-market.or.jp/en/fisheries-market/). It operates via:
- **Licensed wholesalers** who receive, inspect, and value seafood and sell primarily through morning auctions to **intermediate wholesalers (nakaoroshi)** and authorized large buyers [[1]](https://www.toyosu-market.or.jp/en/fisheries-market/).
- A second building where intermediate wholesalers sell onward to retail and foodservice buyers [[1]](https://www.toyosu-market.or.jp/en/fisheries-market/).  

This auction-based structure matters because it:
- Creates **centralized price discovery** and reference prices (often used informally as benchmarks).
- Enables systematic sorting by **freshness, handling, brand/origin**, and often **size**, which is essential for interpreting observed “average” prices as a composite of quality mix.

**Recent regulatory/traceability change (affecting observed prices and comparability pre/post policy):**  
Japan’s **Fishery Products Distribution Act** (promulgated Dec 2020; **effective Dec 2022**) adds mandatory communication/recordkeeping to prevent IUU products in domestic distribution and imports/exports [[4]](https://times.seafoodlegacy.com/en/interview_maikoigarashi1/). The interview source states **“mackerel”** is included in “Specified Class II” species (along with saury, squid, sardine) [[4]](https://times.seafoodlegacy.com/en/interview_maikoigarashi1/). Compliance costs and documentation requirements can:
- Shift transaction costs (potentially widening spreads or changing reported/declared values).
- Change incentives around formal vs informal channels, affecting the representativeness of market price series.

### Korea (Busan as a major auction node; strong import-price linkage)
Korea’s **Busan Cooperative Fish Market** is repeatedly referenced as a major auction hub for mackerel; a 2026 report (secondary journalism) states January auction volume and a sharp y/y increase in wholesale price (KRW/kg) [[5]](https://www.hapskorea.com/mackerel-prices-surge-at-busan-fish-market-as-exports-and-supply-pressures-mount/). While that specific article is not an official bulletin, it is consistent with Korea’s well-known centralized auction/wholesale structure.

More importantly, peer-reviewed/econometric work confirms **imports are structurally important** for Korean mackerel pricing:
- A 2023 study explicitly analyzes **import, producer, wholesale, and retail prices of chub mackerel (_S. japonicus_)** and finds **import price significantly affects retail price**, with **asymmetric price transmission** across stages (NARDL; VECM appears as a related subject term) [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374).
- A 2021 paper uses **monthly consumer prices of frozen mackerel** and includes wholesale and “fresh consumer” prices; it applies **Granger causality** and compares ARMA/ARMAX/VAR forecasting models over **Dec 2013–Jul 2021**, finding the **VAR** model performed best for prediction and that lagged wholesale and fresh consumer prices influence frozen consumer price [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page).

These studies imply that Korean “market price dynamics” are not purely local-supply-driven; they are **jointly determined by import prices, exchange-rate pass-through (via import prices), and domestic distribution margins**—and the margin behavior is non-symmetric (faster/stronger pass-through in one direction than the other) [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374).

### China (multi-market wholesale monitoring; mackerel category prices)
A China wholesale monitoring summary (hosted on a private site summarizing an official-style briefing) claims coverage of **80 aquatic wholesale markets** and reports a line-item **“mackerel 6.89 yuan/kg”** in Oct 2021 [[6]](https://www.caharborfood.com/news/china-aquatic-product-market-price-monitoring-51370029.html). This is useful because it:
- Confirms **units (yuan/kg)** and that “mackerel” is monitored as a commodity.
- Indicates the existence of **broad, multi-market wholesale monitoring**.  

But it is not fully species-explicit (may pool multiple mackerels), and the excerpt does not identify the issuing agency, so it should be treated as **indicative** and ideally cross-validated with the original government bulletin [[6]](https://www.caharborfood.com/news/china-aquatic-product-market-price-monitoring-51370029.html).

### Taiwan (trade shocks can matter more than domestic market structure in available sources)
The captured Taiwan-related evidence is mainly about **cross-strait cold-chain COVID testing trade actions**:
- China suspended imports from Taiwan of some fish products (including “frozen mackerel” category) in Aug 2022 and **resumed** imports March 15, 2023 after China canceled broad cold-chain COVID testing measures [[7]](https://www.tridge.com/news/china-lifts-import-ban-on-taiwan-beltfish-mackerel).  

Even though this is not chub-mackerel-specific, it illustrates a key mechanism: **policy-driven market-access shocks** can cause discrete price/volume regime shifts and complicate year-to-year comparisons if a market alternates between “open” and “restricted” states [[7]](https://www.tridge.com/news/china-lifts-import-ban-on-taiwan-beltfish-mackerel).

### Russia Far East (institution-building toward auctions/exchanges; limited price series captured)
A 2020 Vladivostok report describes the **first international auction** for premium fish products (herring caviar) and explicitly frames Rosrybolovstvo’s goal to create **a Russian fish exchange platform** and potentially require selling part of production through domestic auction sites [[48]](https://fishfocus.co.uk/first-international-fish-auction/). This matters for future mackerel price dynamics because:
- Creating exchange trading tends to improve **price transparency** and standardization of grades/contract terms.
- It may alter bargaining power and marketing margins.  

However, the captured sources do **not** include a usable Russia Far East chub mackerel price bulletin or time series [[48]](https://fishfocus.co.uk/first-international-fish-auction/). So Russia remains a **data gap** in this evidence set.

### United States West Coast (official ex-vessel value system; time series obtainable via NOAA/PacFIN)
For the U.S., the “major market” evidence in the captured sources is institutional/statistical rather than auction-centric:
- NOAA explains that U.S. commercial landings statistics provide **pounds and ex-vessel value** by species/state/time, based on dealer reports/trip tickets/logbooks, representing a census of landings sold at dock [[50]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/commercial-fisheries-landings).  
- NOAA’s **Fisheries One Stop Shop (FOSS)** provides landings query tools and an **API** endpoint for landings/value [[51]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss).  
- NOAA’s Pacific mackerel species page reports that in **2023** commercial landings totaled **1.6 million pounds** valued at **$400,000** [[52]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-mackerel).  

Also relevant: **PacFIN** provides a West Coast inter-agency system with downloadable **landings, revenue, participation** data [[53]](https://pacfin.psmfc.org/).  

This means you can build a consistent **2000–2024 (and later) annual implied ex-vessel price series** as value/landings, but the captured sources do not include the full extracted series values; they show the pathway and one point-year example [[52]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-mackerel), [[50]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/commercial-fisheries-landings), [[51]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss), [[53]](https://pacfin.psmfc.org/).

### Canada, Mexico, Chile (strong leads; limited extracted price series in captured materials)
- **Canada:** only a lead that DFO publishes landed value by province (not opened in the retrieved record) [[54]](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/stats/commercial/land-debarq/sea-maritimes/s2023pv-eng.htm); no mackerel-specific price series captured.
- **Mexico:** CONAPESCA’s **Anuario Estadístico** portal exists (and a 2022 PDF link), but no extracted mackerel price/series in the captured text [[56]](https://www.gob.mx/conapesca/documentos/anuario-estadistico-de-acuacultura-y-pesca), [[57]](https://nube.conapesca.gob.mx/sites/cona/dgppe/2022/ANUARIO_ESTADISTICO_DE_ACUACULTURA_Y_PESCA_2022.pdf).
- **Chile:** SERNAPESCA provides downloadable Excel **time series (“Series cronológicas 2014–2024”)** and landings by species/region/port, which is a strong foundation for quantity dynamics [[59]](https://www.sernapesca.cl/informacion-utilidad/anuarios-estadisticos-de-pesca-y-acuicultura/), but the captured record did not confirm mackerel **price/value** fields from those files.

### Peru (explicit wholesale market bulletins and a “caballa” technical sheet with a price level)
Peru is one of the few Pacific-side countries in the captured sources with explicit **wholesale market price reporting**:
- PRODUCE/OEE “caballa” technical sheet states **average wholesale market price ~4.5 soles/kg**, and that **38% of caballa landings enter wholesale fish markets for fresh consumption** [[65]](https://www.producempresarial.pe/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/158-5.-Ficha-Recurso-Caballa_SET-2024.pdf).
- PRODUCE/OGEIEE wholesale market bulletin (Lima/Callao) shows day-to-day and week-to-week price changes for caballa (e.g., **S/ 2.5 → S/ 2.3**) and similar regional quotes (e.g., **S/ 3.8 → S/ 3.5**) [[66]](https://ogeiee.produce.gob.pe/index.php/en/informacion-sectorial/pesca/mercado-mayorista-pesquero/item/download/1360_80694ddc2c6976d58ca8604859c248bf).  

This is a clear institutional basis for constructing higher-frequency price series (daily/weekly) if archives are accessible, though the captured evidence only shows snapshots [[66]](https://ogeiee.produce.gob.pe/index.php/en/informacion-sectorial/pesca/mercado-mayorista-pesquero/item/download/1360_80694ddc2c6976d58ca8604859c248bf).

## 2) Price dynamics: what is empirically supported in the captured record

### 2.1 Japan: rising wholesale price alongside catch contraction; structural drivers
A major Japanese newspaper reports:
- **Average wholesale price for “mackerel” at Tokyo’s Central Wholesale Market in 2024: 560 yen/kg**, about **+30% vs five years earlier** [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).
- Japan’s mackerel catch in FY2023 (Jul 2023–Jun 2024) about **271,000 tons**, almost **half** of five years earlier [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).
- It attributes catch decrease to **ocean current changes, rising seawater temperatures, and overexploitation** [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566) and notes the end of the **Kuroshio “great meander”** in spring 2025 after 7 years 9 months, with uncertain impacts on catches [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).

**Interpretation (within the limits of the evidence):**
- This is consistent with a supply-constrained price rise (classic inverse relationship between supply and price) in a major price-discovery market [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).
- The “mackerel” category may include multiple species in Japan (e.g., chub and blue mackerel). Without disaggregation, you should treat the 560 yen/kg as a **market-category indicator** rather than a pure chub-mackerel price [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).

Also, MAFF reports broader inflationary pressure in fish products: in 2022 Japan’s CPI for “fresh fish and shellfish” rose **14% y/y**, while purchase volume fell **14%** [[3]](https://www.maff.go.jp/e/data/publish/attach/pdf/index-223.pdf). That is not species-specific, but it reinforces that **macro inflation + supply issues** can shift nominal price levels and volumes [[3]](https://www.maff.go.jp/e/data/publish/attach/pdf/index-223.pdf).

### 2.2 Korea: dynamic, asymmetric price transmission; monthly time series exist
Two key quantitative anchors:

1) **Distribution-stage causality & asymmetry (chub mackerel, S. japonicus)**  
- Import price significantly affects retail price.  
- Asymmetric price transmission occurs across all stages; front-stage vs rear-stage respond differently to increases vs decreases [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374).  
This implies that “market price” is not simply a function of landings; it reflects **border price shocks** (often exchange-rate mediated) plus non-linear margin behavior [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374).

2) **Monthly price series and VAR predictability (frozen mackerel)**  
- Uses monthly data **Dec 2013–Jul 2021** [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page).
- Lagged wholesale price and lagged fresh consumer price affect frozen consumer price [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page).
- VAR outperforms ARMA/ARMAX in forecasting [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page).  
This indicates that mackerel prices embed **multi-stage dynamics** (not a single clearing market), and that short-run forecasting benefits from jointly modeling the system rather than univariate extrapolation [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page).

### 2.3 China: monitored wholesale “mackerel” price exists, but species/grade ambiguity
The monitoring summary shows “mackerel” price and month-on-month change (Oct 2021: 6.89 yuan/kg, down 1.59%) [[6]](https://www.caharborfood.com/news/china-aquatic-product-market-price-monitoring-51370029.html). This is valuable as a proof of monitoring and unit conventions, but any research claiming “chub mackerel” must verify that the commodity definition corresponds to _S. japonicus_ and not an aggregated basket [[6]](https://www.caharborfood.com/news/china-aquatic-product-market-price-monitoring-51370029.html).

### 2.4 Peru: explicit wholesale bulletins (high-frequency), and a technical-sheet “average”
Peru provides unusually direct evidence of wholesale price bulletins:
- Daily/weekly wholesale prices for caballa, with explicit changes and level tables [[66]](https://ogeiee.produce.gob.pe/index.php/en/informacion-sectorial/pesca/mercado-mayorista-pesquero/item/download/1360_80694ddc2c6976d58ca8604859c248bf).
- A reported average wholesale market price level (4.5 soles/kg) and market-channel allocation shares [[65]](https://www.producempresarial.pe/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/158-5.-Ficha-Recurso-Caballa_SET-2024.pdf).  

This supports studying **intra-annual seasonality** (e.g., landings peak Jan–Mar per the same sheet [[65]](https://www.producempresarial.pe/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/158-5.-Ficha-Recurso-Caballa_SET-2024.pdf)) and price response to volume, potentially with lags.

### 2.5 U.S. West Coast: official ex-vessel value series (implied prices), plus historical price dynamics
Modern era:
- NOAA’s landings/value system supports building implied annual ex-vessel prices (value/quantity) [[50]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/commercial-fisheries-landings), [[51]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss).
- A specific point: 2023 landings and value for Pacific mackerel (_S. japonicus_) [[52]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-mackerel).

Long-run historical behavior (useful for theory and interpretation):
- NOAA/NMFS historical analysis (California, 1941–1972) shows how scarcity and fishery collapse/moratoria created **major price volatility and structural breaks**, and stresses that “average price” (value/landings) is quantity-weighted and can be misleading when landings are low [[19]](https://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf-content/mfr37113.pdf).
- It documents segmentation: small quantities sold to fresh markets at prices “considerably higher” than cannery prices [[19]](https://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf-content/mfr37113.pdf).  

Even though this is historical, it is a strong warning for contemporary work: **market outlet mix** (fresh vs processed) can dominate observed average price changes, independent of biomass.

### 2.6 Cross-market price transmission (international): limited direct evidence in captured record
The captured econometric transmission evidence is **within Korea** (import → producer/wholesale/retail) [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374) and within domestic stage interactions [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page). The retrieved record does **not** contain a robust, multi-country cointegration/LOP study for Pacific Rim chub mackerel across Japan–Korea–China–Taiwan–Americas. That remains a gap.

---

## 3) Quality, grading, and the central role of size/condition in price formation

### 3.1 Direct evidence that size drives price (and can be very large in magnitude)
A rigorous study of **size-dependent pricing** in Norwegian ex-vessel data (2000–2010) finds unit price increases significantly with fish weight class for **mackerel** (among others), with mackerel having one of the strongest size effects; in absolute terms it reports an increase “almost **20 NOK/kg**” across weight classes [[69]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/70/7/1389/29147030/fst121.pdf).  
While this is Northeast Atlantic mackerel (_S. scombrus_), not Pacific chub, it provides strong general evidence that mackerel markets can exhibit **steep size premia** [[69]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/70/7/1389/29147030/fst121.pdf)—a mechanism you should assume plausible in Pacific Rim markets unless proven otherwise.

### 3.2 Japan: documented sorting by species type, size, and fat; premium thresholds
Two complementary pieces:

- Industry report for Japan distinguishes **ma-saba (chub mackerel, _S. japonicus_)** from **goma-saba (blue mackerel)** and states that small size/low fat makes some categories unsuitable for retail packs and more likely exported or used for feed/fertilizer; it highlights that in 2015, despite high catch, fish were mostly small and not suited for retail pack products [[72]](https://www.seafood.no/globalassets/aktuelt/webinar/livemoter-presentasjoner/japan-mackerel-report-promar-2018.pdf).  
This is direct qualitative evidence that **size composition changes can shift product allocation** across human consumption vs feed/export channels, thereby changing the *average observed market price* even if total catch stays high [[72]](https://www.seafood.no/globalassets/aktuelt/webinar/livemoter-presentasjoner/japan-mackerel-report-promar-2018.pdf).

- FAO GLOBEFISH describes a premium Japan segment for imported mackerel (“saba nouveau”) and gives explicit thresholds: **>500 g per fish** and **≥30% fat content** for a premium sushi product [[29]](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/rising-popularity-on-norwegian-mackerel-in-japan/en).  
Even though this is Norwegian mackerel context, it demonstrates that Japanese markets can price **fat content and size** explicitly as quality metrics [[29]](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/rising-popularity-on-norwegian-mackerel-in-japan/en). This is crucial for any “resource quality → price” linkage: quality is not abstract; it is operationalized in thresholds.

### 3.3 Freshness and branding also create price premia (and can confound size effects)
- A Tokyo retail hedonic study finds a significant willingness to pay for freshness (bioimpedance measure) for horse mackerel: a 1-SD increase in freshness raises price by **~10.75%** [[73]](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727493). While not chub mackerel, it proves that **measurable freshness commands real premia** in Japanese seafood retail [[73]](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727493).
- A Japan mackerel branding study describes harbor-based brands (e.g., Seki-saba) and shows branding can raise “brand equity” in auction prices, with first-mover advantage for Seki-saba [[74]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306919210000485). Branding is partly tied to environmental/handling narratives (strong currents → firm flesh; strict cooperative handling) [[74]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306919210000485).  

**Implication:** If branded ports also land larger or fatter fish (or handle fish better), then size/condition and brand are correlated; naive regressions of price on size alone risk omitted-variable bias unless brand/origin handling is controlled [[74]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306919210000485).

### 3.4 Market sorting and sampling bias: why observed landings size distributions can be misleading
Two mechanisms are well supported:

1) **Commercial grading creates stratified lots**; sampling must respect this.  
EU grading rules require size-category labeling and uniform lot size; a study shows that a standard sampling scheme can miss size categories “by chance,” biasing size/age compositions, and proposes a size-category-stratified sampling scheme [[70]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/78/8/2757/41764827/fsab151.pdf). While the case is horse mackerel in Portugal, the point generalizes: once fish are **graded/sorted in the market**, any biological size inference from market samples must follow the grading strata [[70]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/78/8/2757/41764827/fsab151.pdf).

2) **Price premia induce market-driven size selection** (fishers change what sizes they supply).  
A study on Mexican snapper shows a 13% premium for “plate-sized” fish shifted supplied size composition (more medium fish, fewer large fish) [[71]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4141077/).  
This is not mackerel, but it establishes a causal channel: **size-price schedules can alter the size distribution of landings**, not just reflect stock size structure [[71]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4141077/).

Together, these are essential warnings for your question about “interannual variations in weight/length” in markets: some observed interannual shifts in landed size can be **economic/market artifacts** (grading + incentives), not purely ecological.

## 4) Interannual biological variation in length/weight: datasets and established drivers (Pacific Rim)

### 4.1 Northwest Pacific (Japan/China/Russia; NPFC stock framework): rich data streams
The NPFC chub mackerel species summary inventories extensive data capable of tracking interannual size structure:
- Japan: port sampling **lengths 1970–2024** (20k–120k fish/year), aging 1970–2024, and age–length keys by quarter and region [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).
- Japan fishery-independent surveys: autumn midwater trawl (1995–2024), summer trawl (2001–2024) for recruitment indices, and egg survey (2005–2024) as SSB index [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).
- China: commercial length-frequency since 2016; aging since 2017; scientific surveys in NPFC area since 2021 [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).
- Russia: acoustic-trawl survey since 2010; research length-frequency since 2010; commercial sampling length/age since 2016 [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).  

**Documented biological drivers (explicit in NPFC summary):**
- Growth can change with **recruitment abundance and oceanic environment** [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).
- A **recent decrease in mean weight-at-age** is “highly likely” induced by **feeding competition** linked to density increases of **chub mackerel and Japanese sardine** [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).  
This is a key mechanistic anchor: interannual weight-at-age decline can occur even when biomass is high, via density-dependent food limitation [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).

### 4.2 East Asian Marginal Seas: long-term size/age shifts consistent with warming and redistribution
A long-term analysis of Japanese purse seine operational data (~half-century) finds:
- **Reduction in size and age in the East China Sea** and **increase in size and age in the northern Sea of Japan** [[42]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S235248552300453X).
- Interpretation: large fish may be more sensitive to warming and shift north faster than small fish; spawning-season truncation toward younger spawners could destabilize dynamics [[42]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S235248552300453X).  

This is exactly the kind of interannual-to-decadal size-structure change that can propagate into markets: fewer large fish locally → fewer high-grade lots → price premia amplify scarcity.

### 4.3 Habitat distribution shifts tied to climate regime indices (PDO in East China Sea)
A habitat suitability study links East China Sea chub mackerel habitat to the **Pacific Decadal Oscillation**:
- PDO index negatively related to vertical temperature anomaly at multiple depths.
- Warm vs cool PDO phases correspond to systematic shifts in water temperature structure and **expansion/contraction + spatial migration** of suitable habitat [[43]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-021-4760-x).  

While it does not directly report size-at-age, it provides a strong environment → habitat availability mechanism that plausibly affects:
- Spatial access of fleets to age/size components.
- Feeding conditions affecting growth/condition.

### 4.4 High seas Northwest Pacific (2016–2021): distribution shift and declining CPUE despite high biomass claim
A study using commercial data reports:
- Fishing grounds concentrated near EEZ edges; gravity center moved **northwest**; CPUE declined year by year 2016–2021 [[44]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12024016/).
- It argues fishing pressure may not be the main reason because biomass was high and large individuals present; emphasizes climate considerations [[44]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12024016/).  

This is consistent with the idea that **availability/catchability changes** (environment-driven) can change realized catches and thus market supply even when stock status is not obviously poor.

### 4.5 California Current (U.S.): precise length/age datasets suitable for interannual size-at-age analysis
NOAA describes survey and port sampling for Pacific mackerel:
- SWFSC CPS summer surveys (2012–2022): lengths **53–402 mm FL**, ages **0–7** [[45]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/52097/noaa_52097_DS1.pdf).
- California port sampling (2008–2022): lengths **84–429 mm FL**, ages **0–9** [[45]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/52097/noaa_52097_DS1.pdf).
- The report details otolith aging methodology and aging uncertainty considerations, important for detecting real interannual size-at-age changes vs measurement noise [[45]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/52097/noaa_52097_DS1.pdf).  

This provides an empirical foundation to link ocean anomalies (e.g., marine heatwaves) to cohort growth and then to landings quality and ex-vessel value.

### 4.6 Marine heatwaves and recruitment environment in the California Current: strong oceanographic “shock” context
CalCOFI-based analysis of the **2014–2016 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave** documents:
- Warmest 3-year period on record; 2015 SST anomaly **1.7°C** highest since 1920; 2014–2016 mean anomaly **1.3°C** highest for any 3-year consecutive period [[46]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/36766/noaa_36766_DS1.pdf).
- Major shifts in larval fish assemblages, phenology, and richness, with both warmwater species expansions and persistence of northern species in cold refugia [[46]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/36766/noaa_36766_DS1.pdf).  
A synthesis for the Northern California Current similarly notes unprecedented biological changes dominated by warmwater gelatinous invertebrates and fishes during the Blob/El Niño period [[47]](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsh.10273).

Even without a chub-mackerel-specific growth estimate in these documents, they justify treating 2014–2016 as an event window likely to create cohort effects (growth/condition/recruitment) in small pelagics—effects that can later appear in size-at-market and thus prices.

### 4.7 South Pacific (Peru/Chile/Ecuador): growth parameter variability and spawning distribution (but limited interannual size series captured)
An SPRFMO species profile compiles spawning seasons and multiple growth parameter estimates for _S. japonicus_ in the eastern Pacific, showing substantial variability in von Bertalanffy parameters across studies and regions [[40]](https://www.sprfmo.int/assets/Meetings/SC/9th-SC-2021/working-papers/SC9-WP03-rev1-Chub-mackerel-Species-profile.pdf). This supports the idea that growth trajectories (and thus size at age) vary spatially and likely temporally.  
However, the captured record does not provide a harmonized year-by-year size-at-age series for Peru/Chile.

---

## 5) Oceanographic theory: how the marine environment should (and often does) drive size/quality, catch timing, and price

Small pelagics like chub mackerel sit at the intersection of:
- **Physical forcing** (SST, currents, stratification, mixed-layer depth)
- **Nutrient supply/upwelling and primary production**
- **Prey field composition (zooplankton abundance/size structure)**
- **Density dependence/competition**
- **Migration timing and spatial overlap with fleets**

The captured sources support several key theoretical pathways:

### 5.1 Climate modes (PDO/ENSO) shift habitat and availability
- PDO-linked habitat shifts for chub mackerel in the East China Sea imply basin-scale climate regimes reorganize habitat suitability and fleet overlap [[43]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-021-4760-x).  
- Japan reporting links catch declines to current changes and warming, and highlights uncertainty around the Kuroshio meander’s end (spring 2025) [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).  

**Theory-to-market implication:** when habitat shifts offshore or northward, fleets may:
- Catch fewer fish (supply contraction → higher prices),
- Catch fish of different size/age composition (changing quality mix → price mix shift),
- Incur higher costs (fuel/time), potentially pushing up first-sale prices if pass-through occurs.

### 5.2 Upwelling / nutrient flux drives prey → growth/condition → size-at-market
A California Current study (sardine-focused) shows wind-stress curl relates to nutricline depth/isopycnal shoaling and chlorophyll, and links sardine production to wind-stress curl over six decades [[80]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0711777105).  
Even though sardine ≠ mackerel, the mechanism generalizes: **upwelling dynamics alter the prey environment** and thus growth and survival of pelagic fish. For chub mackerel, NPFC explicitly notes weight-at-age can change with ocean environment and recruitment/density [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).

### 5.3 Marine heatwaves as nonlinear shock events
The 2014–2016 heatwave evidence shows that ecosystem composition, spawning phenology, and larval distributions shift dramatically during extreme warming [[46]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/36766/noaa_36766_DS1.pdf), [[47]](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsh.10273).  

**Theory-to-market implication:** heatwaves can generate:
- Recruitment failures or booms (cohort strength changes),
- Altered growth rates (size-at-age shifts),
- Changed condition factor (fat content) via prey changes,
leading to multi-year impacts on the size/quality mix hitting markets—often with lags.

### 5.4 Density dependence and interspecific competition: weight-at-age declines even when biomass rises
NPFC explicitly attributes recent mean weight-at-age declines to competition associated with high densities of chub mackerel and Japanese sardine [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).  

**Market implication:** even if total tonnage is high, fish may be **smaller/leaner**, shifting them into lower-value channels (as documented in Japan—small fish unsuitable for retail packs) [[72]](https://www.seafood.no/globalassets/aktuelt/webinar/livemoter-presentasjoner/japan-mackerel-report-promar-2018.pdf), reducing unit values or changing export/domestic allocation.

## 6) Building direct correlations: environment → “high-quality biological resources” → markets → fishery economics

Your core goal is to establish **direct correlations** between (i) high-quality marine biological resources, (ii) aquatic markets and price dynamics, (iii) fishery economics, and (iv) marine environment. The evidence base here supports the *components* strongly, but full end-to-end estimation for Pacific Rim chub mackerel is only partially present. Below is a robust framework consistent with the retrieved studies and the known mechanisms they document.

### 6.1 Define “high-quality biological resource” metrics that map to price premia
Based on the sources, “quality” is operationally tied to:
- **Size (weight class / pieces-per-kg)**
  - Strong size-dependent pricing exists in mackerel markets (Norway ex-vessel evidence) [[69]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/70/7/1389/29147030/fst121.pdf).
  - Japan retail suitability and allocation depends on size [[72]](https://www.seafood.no/globalassets/aktuelt/webinar/livemoter-presentasjoner/japan-mackerel-report-promar-2018.pdf).
- **Condition / fat content**
  - Japan premium mackerel segment uses explicit fat thresholds (≥30%) and weight (>500g) [[29]](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/rising-popularity-on-norwegian-mackerel-in-japan/en).
- **Freshness / handling**
  - Freshness has measurable price premia in Tokyo retail for species eaten raw [[73]](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727493).
- **Origin/brand and handling protocols**
  - Harbor brands and cooperative controls can raise auction price/brand equity [[74]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306919210000485).

These should become your **resource-quality indices**:
- Mean length, mean weight, and distribution percentiles (e.g., P75 length).
- Weight-at-age (from otolith/ALK systems) and **mean weight-at-age anomalies** [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf), [[45]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/52097/noaa_52097_DS1.pdf).
- Condition factor proxies (length–weight residuals) where weights exist [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).
- Fat content (if measured) or proxies (season + condition).
- Freshness/handling grade, brand/origin.

### 6.2 Link quality metrics to prices using market microstructure-aware models
Key caution: grading/sorting and market-driven selection bias must be controlled [[70]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/78/8/2757/41764827/fsab151.pdf), [[71]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4141077/), [[72]](https://www.seafood.no/globalassets/aktuelt/webinar/livemoter-presentasjoner/japan-mackerel-report-promar-2018.pdf).

Recommended empirical approaches (aligned with evidence in the record):

1) **Hedonic price models** (price as a function of size, fat/condition, freshness, origin/brand, day/market fixed effects)  
- Supported by hedonic freshness methodology [[73]](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727493).
- Include origin/brand controls to avoid confounding [[74]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306919210000485).

2) **Size-dependent price schedule estimation** (piecewise linear or GAM on weight class)  
- Supported by mixed models/GAM approach used to estimate size-based price effects in mackerel [[69]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/70/7/1389/29147030/fst121.pdf).

3) **Distribution-stage transmission models** (import → wholesale → retail; asymmetry)  
- Empirically demonstrated for chub mackerel in Korea (NARDL; asymmetric pass-through) [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374).
- For monthly dynamics, VAR methods have empirical support in Korea [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page).

4) **VAR/VECM with exogenous climate indices (VARX/VECMX)**  
- While a Pacific chub-mackerel multi-market cointegration study is not captured, VECM frameworks are widely used for fish prices and landings relationships [[87]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312080314_Testing_for_substitutability_in_the_mackerel_market_a_new_method_using_fractional_cointegration), and VAR is used for price transmission/volatility along the value chain [[88]](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/conference_proceedings_or_journals/37720n05w). These provide methodological templates.

### 6.3 Connect environment to biology and catchability (availability), then to market supply and prices
For the environment → availability step, the record supports:
- Habitat suitability shifts with PDO [[43]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-021-4760-x).
- Spatio-temporal Bayesian models including SST and chlorophyll to explain fish availability/CPUE (jack mackerel example, but directly transferable) [[79]](https://www.sprfmo.int/assets/Meetings/02-SC/11th-SC-2023/Jack-Mackerel/SC11-JM07-CHL-A-Bayesian-spatio-temporal-approach-for-the-standardization-of-CPUE-in-the-TM-fishery-off-central-southern-Chile.pdf).
- Heatwave-driven ecosystem restructuring and likely cohort impacts [[46]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/36766/noaa_36766_DS1.pdf), [[47]](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsh.10273).

For the supply → price step, the record supports:
- Catch contraction coinciding with price increases in Japan [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).
- Climate indices influencing landings and indirectly first-sale prices via supply-demand (non-Pacific example, but directly relevant mechanism) [[83]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356580538_Effect_of_climatic_oscillations_on_small_pelagic_fisheries_and_its_economic_profit_in_the_Gulf_of_Cadiz).
- Climate variability influencing fish price behavior and economic losses (Bali Strait sardine example) [[84]](https://www.conservation-strategy.org/sites/default/files/field-file/MFP_Sardines_English_Optimized.pdf).

So the full empirical chain you can estimate is:

**Environment (PDO/ENSO, SST, MHW indices, upwelling proxies, chl-a)**  
→ **Habitat/availability (HSI; spatio-temporal CPUE standardization)** [[43]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-021-4760-x), [[79]](https://www.sprfmo.int/assets/Meetings/02-SC/11th-SC-2023/Jack-Mackerel/SC11-JM07-CHL-A-Bayesian-spatio-temporal-approach-for-the-standardization-of-CPUE-in-the-TM-fishery-off-central-southern-Chile.pdf)  
→ **Recruitment/growth/weight-at-age (survey + port biological time series)** [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf), [[45]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/52097/noaa_52097_DS1.pdf)  
→ **Catch timing/volume/composition (monthly catch seasonality; gear/area)** [[22]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2025-06/NPFC-2025-TWG%20CMSA11-IP01%20Recent%20Fishery%20and%20Stock%20Status%20of%20CHUB%20JP.pdf)  
→ **Market supply by grade (size/fat/freshness/origin)** [[29]](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/rising-popularity-on-norwegian-mackerel-in-japan/en), [[72]](https://www.seafood.no/globalassets/aktuelt/webinar/livemoter-presentasjoner/japan-mackerel-report-promar-2018.pdf)  
→ **Wholesale/auction prices (Japan), multi-stage prices (Korea), wholesale bulletins (Peru), ex-vessel implied prices (US)** [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566), [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374), [[66]](https://ogeiee.produce.gob.pe/index.php/en/informacion-sectorial/pesca/mercado-mayorista-pesquero/item/download/1360_80694ddc2c6976d58ca8604859c248bf), [[50]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/commercial-fisheries-landings)  
→ **Economic outcomes (revenue per unit effort; margins; welfare)** (methodological support from climate–economy fishery studies) [[84]](https://www.conservation-strategy.org/sites/default/files/field-file/MFP_Sardines_English_Optimized.pdf).

## 7) What can be concluded now (from retrieved sources) vs what remains to be built

### 7.1 Strong, evidence-backed conclusions (supported directly)
1) **Chub mackerel size/weight-at-age varies interannually and can decline via density-dependent competition**, not only via overfishing or warming alone. NPFC attributes recent weight-at-age decreases to feeding competition linked to high densities of chub mackerel and Japanese sardine [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).  
2) **Large-scale climate variability reorganizes habitat**, affecting where/when mackerel are catchable (PDO-driven habitat shifts in ECS) [[43]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-021-4760-x).  
3) **Market prices respond strongly to supply contraction** in major reference markets (Tokyo wholesale mackerel price up ~30% vs 5 years earlier alongside catch roughly halving) [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).  
4) **Korean chub mackerel retail prices are strongly influenced by import prices**, and price transmission is **asymmetric** across distribution stages [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374).  
5) **Size and condition are genuine market value drivers in mackerel systems**, evidenced by strong size-dependent pricing (mackerel ex-vessel) [[69]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/70/7/1389/29147030/fst121.pdf) and explicit Japanese premium thresholds on weight and fat content [[29]](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/rising-popularity-on-norwegian-mackerel-in-japan/en), with Japan also documenting channel sorting when fish are small [[72]](https://www.seafood.no/globalassets/aktuelt/webinar/livemoter-presentasjoner/japan-mackerel-report-promar-2018.pdf).  
6) **Market sorting/grading and economic incentives can bias observed size distributions**, requiring stratified sampling designs and careful interpretation [[70]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/78/8/2757/41764827/fsab151.pdf), [[71]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4141077/), [[72]](https://www.seafood.no/globalassets/aktuelt/webinar/livemoter-presentasjoner/japan-mackerel-report-promar-2018.pdf).

### 7.2 High-value gaps (limitations of the captured record)
1) **Cross-country price transmission/cointegration across Pacific Rim markets** for chub mackerel is not established in the retrieved sources (only within-country/stage evidence in Korea) [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374), [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page).  
2) **Russia Far East**, **Mexico**, **Canada**, and **Chile** price series are not extracted here; there are strong institutional leads (e.g., SERNAPESCA downloadable series) but not confirmed mackerel price time series in the captured text [[59]](https://www.sernapesca.cl/informacion-utilidad/anuarios-estadisticos-de-pesca-y-acuicultura/).  
3) In several datasets, “mackerel” is **not species-resolved**, complicating chub-mackerel specificity (Japan “mackerel” market price [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566); China “mackerel” commodity monitoring [[6]](https://www.caharborfood.com/news/china-aquatic-product-market-price-monitoring-51370029.html)).  
4) **Nominal vs real price deflation** is not systematically done in the modern Pacific Rim mackerel sources captured. The strongest explicit deflation methodology is historical California (deflation by wholesale price index) [[19]](https://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf-content/mfr37113.pdf). For contemporary work, CPI/PPI deflation and exchange-rate normalization must be added.

---

## 8) A practical, research-grade blueprint to deliver the correlations you want

### Step A — Build harmonized price series by market and product form
- **Japan:** Extract auction/wholesale series by species (ma-saba vs goma-saba if possible), market (Toyosu/other), form (fresh/frozen), and grade if available; the 2024 Tokyo wholesale “mackerel” benchmark (560 yen/kg) is a starting anchor [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).  
- **Korea:** Use the already-demonstrated monthly datasets (Dec 2013–Jul 2021) and extend; explicitly model import price and distribution-stage asymmetry [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374), [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page).  
- **China:** Validate the “80 wholesale markets” monitoring series at the official source and resolve commodity definition beyond “mackerel” [[6]](https://www.caharborfood.com/news/china-aquatic-product-market-price-monitoring-51370029.html).  
- **Peru:** Programmatically scrape/collect PRODUCE wholesale bulletins to build daily/weekly series for caballa and cross-check species definition [[66]](https://ogeiee.produce.gob.pe/index.php/en/informacion-sectorial/pesca/mercado-mayorista-pesquero/item/download/1360_80694ddc2c6976d58ca8604859c248bf), [[65]](https://www.producempresarial.pe/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/158-5.-Ficha-Recurso-Caballa_SET-2024.pdf).  
- **U.S.:** Pull NOAA FOSS landings + ex-vessel value via API and compute implied annual ex-vessel prices; link to PacFIN as a cross-check [[50]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/commercial-fisheries-landings), [[51]](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss), [[53]](https://pacfin.psmfc.org/).  
- **Chile/Mexico/Russia/Canada:** Use the identified official portals as ingestion targets (SERNAPESCA series files [[59]](https://www.sernapesca.cl/informacion-utilidad/anuarios-estadisticos-de-pesca-y-acuicultura/), CONAPESCA yearbooks [[56]](https://www.gob.mx/conapesca/documentos/anuario-estadistico-de-acuacultura-y-pesca), Russia exchange/auction publications if available [[48]](https://fishfocus.co.uk/first-international-fish-auction/), DFO series [[54]](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/stats/commercial/land-debarq/sea-maritimes/s2023pv-eng.htm)).

### Step B — Build interannual size/condition series (biological “quality supply”)
- **NPFC region:** Use port sampling and survey data inventories that include length/weight/age/maturity across Japan/China/Russia [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf). Create:
  - Length distributions by year/season/area/gear
  - Weight-at-age and residual condition indices
  - Recruitment proxies (age-0 indices) and egg density SSB indices [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf)  
- **Japan regional shift component:** incorporate long-term changes in size/age across ECS vs northern Sea of Japan [[42]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S235248552300453X).  
- **U.S.:** Use SWFSC and CDFW sampled lengths/ages to compute cohort growth anomalies and size-at-age by year class [[45]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/52097/noaa_52097_DS1.pdf).

### Step C — Integrate oceanography explicitly (mechanisms + lags)
Use both mechanistic and statistical drivers:
- **PDO** (ECS habitat shifts) [[43]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-021-4760-x)

Then estimate lag structures (0–3+ years), consistent with documented delayed biological/economic impacts in climate–fishery studies [[84]](https://www.conservation-strategy.org/sites/default/files/field-file/MFP_Sardines_English_Optimized.pdf), [[85]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X25000466).

### Step D — Estimate the environment → quality → price chain with models that match market realities
Use a layered approach (modular, but integratable):

1) **Environment → availability/CPUE**  
- Spatio-temporal Bayesian models with SST/chl-a covariates (method exemplified in pelagics) [[79]](https://www.sprfmo.int/assets/Meetings/02-SC/11th-SC-2023/Jack-Mackerel/SC11-JM07-CHL-A-Bayesian-spatio-temporal-approach-for-the-standardization-of-CPUE-in-the-TM-fishery-off-central-southern-Chile.pdf).

2) **Environment + density → growth/weight-at-age**  
- State-space growth or weight-at-age anomaly models, using NPFC’s documented density/competition mechanism as a core hypothesis [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).

3) **Supply (quantity + grade mix) → price**  
- Japan: auction price regressions including size/fat proxies, seasonality, and landings volume.  
- Korea: NARDL/VAR price transmission with import price shocks [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374), [[24]](https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202122960337615.page).  
- Peru: high-frequency price–volume response at wholesale markets [[66]](https://ogeiee.produce.gob.pe/index.php/en/informacion-sectorial/pesca/mercado-mayorista-pesquero/item/download/1360_80694ddc2c6976d58ca8604859c248bf).  

4) **Cross-market linkage**  
- Once comparable series exist, test cointegration/LOP across Japan–Korea–China and trade-linked nodes, using VECM templates (prices with quantities as drivers) [[87]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312080314_Testing_for_substitutability_in_the_mackerel_market_a_new_method_using_fractional_cointegration).

## 9) Bottom line: what this establishes about correlations among marine resources, markets, economics, and environment

From the retrieved evidence, the most defensible integrated statements are:

- **Environmental variability (PDO/SST anomalies/heatwaves/currents) changes habitat and productivity**, which shifts **availability** and **recruitment/growth conditions** for pelagic fish [[43]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-021-4760-x), [[46]](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/36766/noaa_36766_DS1.pdf), [[47]](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsh.10273), [[80]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0711777105).  
- **Biological quality of the resource (size, weight-at-age, condition/fat) is not stable interannually** and can deteriorate through **density-dependent competition** even during high biomass periods [[41]](https://www.npfc.int/system/files/2026-01/Chub%20Mackerel%202026.pdf).  
- **Markets price “quality” strongly**—size-dependent pricing can be steep in mackerel systems [[69]](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/70/7/1389/29147030/fst121.pdf), and Japan’s premium segments formalize minimum size and fat content thresholds [[29]](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/rising-popularity-on-norwegian-mackerel-in-japan/en).  
- Therefore, the marine environment influences fishery economics via **two coupled channels**:
  1) **Quantity channel** (catch volume changes → price responds, as seen in Japan’s catch contraction with price rise) [[20]](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16122566).
  2) **Quality-mix channel** (size/condition shifts → product allocation changes across retail vs export/feed and across premium vs commodity segments) [[72]](https://www.seafood.no/globalassets/aktuelt/webinar/livemoter-presentasjoner/japan-mackerel-report-promar-2018.pdf), [[29]](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/rising-popularity-on-norwegian-mackerel-in-japan/en).  
- In import-dependent systems, **international price shocks propagate asymmetrically through the value chain**, so environmental impacts in one region can transmit via trade to retail prices elsewhere (Korea import price → retail price; asymmetry) [[23]](https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122646/records/65e9b29f0bb82ea8d51d7374).

What remains is to **quantify** these correlations consistently across Pacific Rim countries using harmonized, species-resolved price and size/condition series—something the captured sources strongly motivate and partially enable (Japan/Korea/Peru/U.S. pathways are clearest), but do not yet fully deliver for all target markets (Russia/Mexico/Chile/Canada gaps) [[59]](https://www.sernapesca.cl/informacion-utilidad/anuarios-estadisticos-de-pesca-y-acuicultura/), [[56]](https://www.gob.mx/conapesca/documentos/anuario-estadistico-de-acuacultura-y-pesca), [[48]](https://fishfocus.co.uk/first-international-fish-auction/), [[54]](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/stats/commercial/land-debarq/sea-maritimes/s2023pv-eng.htm).
