Query ID: 55
============================================================

QUESTION:
While the market features diverse quantitative strategies like multi-factor and high-frequency trading, it lacks a single, standardized benchmark for assessing their performance across multiple dimensions such as returns, risk, and adaptability to market conditions. Could we develop a general yet rigorous evaluation framework to enable accurate comparison and analysis of various advanced quant strategies?

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (6 total):
  #1: Research existing evaluation standards/benchmarks and reporting conventions used across quant strategy types (multi-factor, stat arb, trend/CTA, options/volatility, HFT/market making). Identify where these metrics fail for cross-strategy comparability (time horizon, leverage/financing, capacity, microstructure, execution). Focus on 2015-2026 practitioner and academic sources and any industry standards (CFA, GIPS, AIMA, ISDA, Basel, SEC).
  #2: Research robust cross-strategy performance and risk metrics suitable for a standardized evaluation framework: return normalization, volatility/serial correlation corrections, drawdown/path risk, tail risk (VaR/ES), factor-adjusted alpha, utility-based and probabilistic metrics. Include best practices for annualization, leverage normalization, and handling autocorrelation for high-frequency and illiquid strategies.
  #3: Research validation methodologies and anti-overfitting protocols for quant strategies to enable apples-to-apples comparison: walk-forward, purged/embargoed cross-validation, combinatorial purged CV, White’s reality check, Deflated Sharpe, multiple testing corrections, backtest overfitting diagnostics, survivorship/selection bias controls, and intraday replay/backtest consistency techniques.
  #4: Research how to incorporate market-regime conditioning and adaptability into a quant strategy evaluation framework: regime detection methods (HMM, clustering, volatility regimes, macro states), conditional performance attribution, stress testing, scenario analysis, and protocols for consistent regime definitions across assets/frequencies (2015-2026 academic + practitioner).
  #5: Research evaluation dimensions beyond returns/risk that enable fair cross-strategy comparison: liquidity, capacity, transaction cost and slippage modeling, financing/leverage normalization, and operational complexity. Include sources relevant to HFT/market making (microstructure metrics like spread capture, fill rates, inventory risk, latency) and how to benchmark them against longer-horizon strategies.
  #6: Research how to integrate metrics into a single benchmarking/reporting standard ('quant strategy scorecard'): aggregation/weighting vs Pareto-front approaches, minimum reporting checklists, reproducibility and transparency standards, and how standards should reflect 2024-2026 market structure changes (fees, tick sizes, fragmented liquidity, crypto venues).

============================================================

ANSWER:
Yes. You can build a *general yet rigorous* evaluation framework that compares advanced quant strategies across horizons and market structures—provided you (1) standardize **what is being measured** (economic P&L vs. reported NAV vs. hypothetical index), (2) normalize for **implementation and constraints** (costs, capacity, leverage/financing, liquidity), and (3) enforce a **validation and disclosure protocol** that makes results auditable and resistant to overfitting.

Below is a concrete blueprint you can implement as an industry-style standard: a **Quant Strategy Evaluation Framework (QSEF)** plus a **Quant Strategy Scorecard (QSS)**.

---

## 1) Why the market lacks a single benchmark today (and what exists)

### 1.1 Existing “standards” are fragmented by purpose

**(A) Performance presentation standards (asset-management reporting)**  
- **GIPS** is the closest thing to a global reporting standard for investment performance presentation. Its core aim is comparability through standardized calculation/presentation, composite construction rules (to reduce cherry-picking), and disclosure requirements [[1]](https://www.gipsstandards.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_gips_standards_firms.pdf), [[51]](https://www.gipsstandards.org/standards/gips-standards-for-firms/gips-standards-handbook-for-firms/).  
- But GIPS is not designed to compare *heterogeneous quant trading programs* on *implementation realism*, *capacity*, *execution quality*, or *model selection/overfitting risk*. It also draws a hard line between **actual performance** and **hypothetical/backtested** results, which are not GIPS-compliant performance and must be clearly separated if shown [[51]](https://www.gipsstandards.org/standards/gips-standards-for-firms/gips-standards-handbook-for-firms/).

**(B) Regulatory performance/marketing constraints**  
- SEC marketing rule FAQs emphasize required time windows, issues with extracted performance, and practical difficulty of computing “net” versions of portfolio characteristics like volatility or Sharpe [[3]](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/division-investment-management-frequently-asked-questions/marketing-compliance-frequently-asked-questions). This constrains how strategies are marketed, but doesn’t define a cross-strategy evaluation benchmark.

**(C) Strategy-category indices (benchmarks by style)**
- **Trend/CTA** reporting often includes net-of-fee index returns, volatility, Sharpe, and drawdown, sometimes with a leverage proxy like margin/equity (e.g., SG Trend Indicator reporting) [[10]](https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/fileadmin/indices_feeds/ti_screen/index.html).  
- **Options/volatility** has extensive families of *rules-based hypothetical option strategy indices* (e.g., buy-write/put-write/protection) [[11]](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/indices/documents/benchmarks-fact-sheet.pdf), and volatility hedge fund indices grouped by exposure type (short vol, long vol, RV, tail risk) [[12]](https://ir.cboe.com/news/news-details/2015/CBOE-Launches-Hedge-Fund-Benchmarks-with-Eurekahedge-08-18-2015/default.aspx).  
- These are valuable *within-category* but not a unified yardstick across very different quant styles.

**(D) Risk capital / margin standards (risk measurement, not investor performance)**
- **ISDA SIMM** standardizes initial margin for OTC derivatives with explicit horizon/confidence (10-day, 99%) and sensitivity-based inputs [[6]](https://www.isda.org/a/C8RgE/ISDA-SIMM-The-Trusted-Standard-for-Initial-Margin-Calculations.pdf).  
- **Basel/FRTB** market risk standards push expected shortfall and model eligibility tests at desk level, but are about bank capital, and regulators explicitly note disclosure granularity can reduce comparability and reveal proprietary strategy details [[7]](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d457.htm), [[8]](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d529.pdf).  
These frameworks are helpful as *inputs* to a strategy scorecard (tail risk, liquidity, leverage feasibility), but they’re not performance benchmarks.

**(E) Due diligence standardization**
- **AIMA DDQs** are “industry-standard templates” to standardize manager information for like-for-like due diligence [[4]](https://www.aima.org/sound-practices/due-diligence-questionnaires.html).  
They are not a quantitative benchmarking standard, but they suggest how standardization succeeds in practice: common questions + consistent disclosure.

**(F) Backtest governance guidance**
- **SBAI** provides practical investor-oriented guidance on backtests, warning about overfitting, requiring separation of backtest vs live, and recommending explicit questions about trials, costs, slippage, financing, and governance [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf).  
This is directly aligned with what a cross-strategy quant evaluation standard must incorporate.

---

### 1.2 Where comparability fails today (failure modes you must design around)

1) **Horizon dependence & serial correlation break naive annualization**  
- Sharpe annualization via √T is wrong except in special cases; serial correlation can inflate Sharpe dramatically and reorder rankings [[13]](https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/research/financial-analysts-journal/2002/the-statistics-of-sharpe-ratios).  
- Illiquidity-driven smoothing creates serial correlation and biases volatility/Sharpe, as well as correlations and betas [[15]](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9571).

2) **Different “return objects” are compared as if they were the same**  
- NAV-based monthly hedge fund returns vs. intraday mark-to-market vs. hypothetical index returns vs. execution-level P&L are not comparable without a mapping layer.

3) **Leverage/financing and constraints are often implicit, not standardized**  
- A strategy’s return can be mostly a function of financing terms, margin rules, borrow availability, and liquidity haircuts—yet many reports lack standardized disclosures here (SBAI explicitly flags financing/borrow fees as required backtest assumptions to interrogate) [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf).  
- Some reporting (e.g., trend indices) includes margin/equity, but not as a universal standard [[10]](https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/fileadmin/indices_feeds/ti_screen/index.html).

4) **Transaction costs and execution realism differ massively across strategies**
- Execution evaluation requires appropriate benchmarks (arrival price / implementation shortfall) and must account for market impact and timing risk [[45]](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/finread/impshort.pdf), [[47]](https://quantitativebrokers.com/s/Optimal-Execution-of-Portfolio-Transaction-_-AlmgrenChriss-1999.pdf).  
- Microstructure strategies require spreads, realized spreads, adverse selection/price impact, fill probability, and latency considerations—none of which appear in conventional “fund return” benchmarking [[44]](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12465v1), [[46]](https://www.sec.gov/files/dera_wp_tick_size-market_quality.pdf), [[48]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3115).

5) **Selection bias, multiple testing, and backtest overfitting**
- Without controlling for data snooping, the “best” strategy from a large search is often a statistical fluke [[22]](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/718/White2000.pdf).  
- Bailey & López de Prado argue that without knowing the number of trials, a backtest’s relevance can be impossible to assess; they propose Deflated Sharpe concepts to correct for multiple testing and non-normality [[17]](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbpapers/deflated-sharpe.pdf).  
- SBAI recommends explicitly asking how many trials, which anti-overfit techniques, and whether out-of-sample testing was done [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf).

6) **Regime dependence and adaptability are rarely evaluated consistently**
- Regimes can be defined ex-ante (e.g., risk-on/off) or via clustering/HMM/mixtures [[33]](https://macrosynergy.com/research/classifying-market-regimes/), [[34]](https://www.twosigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Regime-Modeling_.pdf), [[37]](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/assets/pdf/global/pc/2025/decoding-market-regimes-with-machine-learning.pdf), [[39]](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/13/12/311).  
- Without standardized regime definitions, “adaptability” becomes storytelling rather than measurement.

7) **Market structure is changing (2024–2026)**
- SEC has modernized execution-quality reporting under Rule 605 to reflect transformed markets and requires finer time-to-execution and additional spread metrics [[55]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-32).  
- Tick size/access fee changes (and shifting compliance timelines) change microstructure and therefore backtest portability; compliance dates have already moved via exemptive relief [[58]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-137), [[60]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-130-sec-issues-exemptive-order-regarding-compliance-certain-rules-under-regulation-nms).  
- Off-exchange share exceeded 50% in 2025 (per Cboe commentary), so venue segmentation matters for execution-sensitive strategies [[61]](https://www.cboe.com/insights/posts/2025-u-s-equities-year-in-review/).  
- Crypto adds 24/7 fragmentation across CEX/DEX and makes effective spread and implementation shortfall more meaningful than quoted spread alone [[62]](https://www.bitgo.com/resources/blog/crypto-liquidity/).

---

## 2) The design principles of a cross-strategy evaluation framework

A workable “general yet rigorous” framework should obey four principles:

### Principle A — Separate **strategy skill** from **implementation environment**
Report performance under:
1) **Raw** (gross, before costs/financing)  
2) **Implementable** (net of realistic costs, fees, borrow, funding)  
3) **Constrained** (under standardized risk/leverage/capacity rules)

SBAI explicitly stresses “real life” assumptions (slippage, delay, transaction costs, financing/borrow fees) and separation of backtests vs actual [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf). This becomes a structural requirement, not a footnote.

### Principle B — Standardize the **economic unit of comparison**
Convert every strategy—whether HFT market making, options selling, or factor long/short—into a comparable **return-on-capital** object under explicit capital definitions:
- Net liquidation value / equity at risk
- Initial/variation margin for derivatives (SIMM-like framing can inform feasibility) [[6]](https://www.isda.org/a/C8RgE/ISDA-SIMM-The-Trusted-Standard-for-Initial-Margin-Calculations.pdf)
- Inventory limits for market making [[44]](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12465v1), [[48]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3115)

You won’t force identical mechanics; you will force explicit “capital at risk” accounting.

### Principle C — Report a **vector** of metrics, not one number
Any single scalar (Sharpe, CAGR, IR) is easy to game and unstable across non-normality, serial correlation, and regime shifts [[13]](https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/research/financial-analysts-journal/2002/the-statistics-of-sharpe-ratios), [[15]](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9571).  
A real benchmark must be multi-dimensional.

### Principle D — Make results **auditable and resistant to selection bias**
Enforce:
- Overfitting controls (reality check / multiple testing corrections) [[22]](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/718/White2000.pdf), [[17]](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbpapers/deflated-sharpe.pdf), [[53]](https://people.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P120_Backtesting.PDF)
- Clear separation of hypothetical vs live [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf), [[51]](https://www.gipsstandards.org/standards/gips-standards-for-firms/gips-standards-handbook-for-firms/)
- Repeatable execution modeling (event-based backtest for intraday) [[31]](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-quant-news/a-practical-breakdown-of-vector-based-vs-event-based-backtesting/), with explicit slippage/liquidity models [[32]](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/blob/master/zipline/finance/slippage.py)
- Recordkeeping and metadata (regulatory reporting offers a template mindset for machine-readable disclosures and retention) [[54]](https://dart.deloitte.com/USDART/home/accounting/sec/rules-regulations/255-proprietary-trading-certain-interests-in/appendix-a-reporting-recordkeeping-requirement-for)

---

## 3) Core dimensions QSEF must measure (the “minimum sufficient set”)

Think of QSEF as defining **6 pillars**, each with standardized metrics and required disclosures.

### Pillar 1 — Returns (absolute, relative, and path-aware)

**Required:**
- Periodic returns (daily/weekly/monthly as appropriate) + cumulative equity curve
- CAGR / annualized mean (but computed with correct aggregation conventions)
- **Drawdowns**: max drawdown, current drawdown (trend index reporting highlights these as core) [[10]](https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/fileadmin/indices_feeds/ti_screen/index.html)

**Why not just CAGR?**  
Because path risk is central for leveraged and convexity-heavy strategies (vol selling, trend, stat arb). Drawdown-based reporting is widely understood and already present in some benchmark conventions [[10]](https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/fileadmin/indices_feeds/ti_screen/index.html).

---

### Pillar 2 — Risk (volatility, tails, and serial correlation)

#### 2.1 Volatility and Sharpe—done correctly
**Required:**
- Volatility (annualized)
- Sharpe ratio *with explicit annualization method and serial-correlation correction*

**Standardization rule:**  
- If returns are serially correlated (common for illiquid strategies), naive √T Sharpe scaling is invalid [[13]](https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/research/financial-analysts-journal/2002/the-statistics-of-sharpe-ratios).  
- Illiquidity smoothing biases volatility down and Sharpe up; you should measure/report serial correlation and include a smoothing-aware adjustment or at least a penalty flag [[15]](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9571).

#### 2.2 Tail risk and coherent measures
**Required:**
- Expected Shortfall / CVaR at standard confidence levels (e.g., 95%, 99%)  
Rockafellar & Uryasev show CVaR has coherent/convex properties and avoids some VaR pathologies [[16]](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~rtr/papers/rtr179-CVaR1.pdf).

**Optional but recommended:**
- VaR alongside ES for familiarity, but ES is the core tail metric.

#### 2.3 Autocorrelation-robust inference for alpha/exposures
Whenever you estimate regression alpha/betas, use HAC standard errors (e.g., Newey–West) to avoid overconfident inference under autocorrelation/heteroskedasticity [[18]](https://www.stata.com/manuals/tsnewey.pdf).

---

### Pillar 3 — Exposures & “what drives returns” (comparability via a common risk language)

A cross-strategy framework should require that every strategy be decomposed into:
- **Traditional market exposures** (equity, rates, credit, FX, commodities)
- **Style/alternative risk premia** exposures (value, momentum, carry, trend, volatility selling/buying, liquidity)

Even if you disagree on the “right” factor set, forcing a *common exposure report* makes strategies comparable on *economic risk*, not just outcome.

**Important:** illiquidity smoothing biases correlations and betas too [[15]](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9571), so exposures should be computed on returns adjusted/diagnosed for smoothing where needed.

**Deliverables:**
- Factor regression summary (alpha, betas, R²)
- Stability of betas over time (rolling or regime-conditioned)

---

### Pillar 4 — Implementation realism (costs, execution quality, and capacity)

This is where cross-strategy comparability usually breaks—and where your framework will add the most value.

#### 4.1 Execution cost benchmarking: implementation shortfall
For any strategy that trades in public markets, require:
- **Implementation Shortfall (IS) / arrival-price slippage**: the benchmark is the decision/arrival midprice [[45]](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/finread/impshort.pdf).  
- Report distribution of IS (mean and dispersion), not just average; Almgren–Chriss formalizes the expected-cost vs variance-of-cost frontier that captures the trade-off between impact and timing risk [[47]](https://quantitativebrokers.com/s/Optimal-Execution-of-Portfolio-Transaction-_-AlmgrenChriss-1999.pdf).

This becomes the common “execution unit” across low-frequency and high-frequency strategies:
- A weekly rebalanced factor strategy still has IS.
- A stat arb strategy has IS on entries/exits.
- An HFT strategy can be decomposed into *effective spread paid/earned* and adverse selection (below).

#### 4.2 Microstructure strategy metrics (HFT / market making)
For HFT/MM, “return” alone is meaningless without microstructure decomposition. Require:
- **Quoted spread, effective spread, realized spread, and price impact** (adverse selection proxy) as standard liquidity/microstructure metrics [[46]](https://www.sec.gov/files/dera_wp_tick_size-market_quality.pdf).  
  - Realized spread is explicitly framed as market maker revenue from supplying liquidity [[46]](https://www.sec.gov/files/dera_wp_tick_size-market_quality.pdf).  
  - Price impact is a proxy for adverse selection costs to liquidity providers [[46]](https://www.sec.gov/files/dera_wp_tick_size-market_quality.pdf).  
- **Latency and queue-position metrics** where applicable (fill probability depends on these). A market-making modeling framework explicitly incorporates latency, queue position normalization (RQP), and competitiveness measures that affect execution likelihood [[44]](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12465v1). Even if you use different internal definitions, the framework should require *some* standardized reporting of latency assumptions and fill modeling.

#### 4.3 Slippage models must be explicit and comparable
Backtests should not hide behind “fills at close.” Require:
- Event-based backtesting for intraday strategies (or a clear justification otherwise) [[31]](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-quant-news/a-practical-breakdown-of-vector-based-vs-event-based-backtesting/).
- Explicit slippage model choice and parameters (e.g., volume-share with price impact and volume limits demonstrates how assumptions constrain fill sizes and enforce liquidity capacity) [[32]](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/blob/master/zipline/finance/slippage.py).

#### 4.4 Capacity and liquidity
Capacity is strategy-specific, but you can standardize *how it is measured*:
- Report performance and IS as a function of participation rate / %ADV buckets.
- Report degradation curves (e.g., P&L vs notional, Sharpe vs notional).
- Include liquidity-state conditioning: the RL execution literature explicitly shows liquidity/volatility regimes materially shift slippage outcomes and supports regime-specialist policies [[43]](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.22113v1).

#### 4.5 Venue/session segmentation (modern necessity)
Given:
- execution-quality reporting modernization under SEC Rule 605 [[55]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-32),
- off-exchange volume >50% in 2025 (commentary) [[61]](https://www.cboe.com/insights/posts/2025-u-s-equities-year-in-review/),
- and rising pre-market activity [[61]](https://www.cboe.com/insights/posts/2025-u-s-equities-year-in-review/),
the framework should require segmentation for execution-sensitive strategies:
- regular hours vs pre/after hours
- on-exchange displayed vs non-displayed vs off-exchange

Crypto analog: fragmentation across CEX/DEX and 24/7 trading makes effective spread and IS the correct liquidity yardsticks, with venue reliability and rejection behavior tracked [[62]](https://www.bitgo.com/resources/blog/crypto-liquidity/).

---

### Pillar 5 — Robustness & adaptability (market regimes, stress tests, and “break” analysis)

“Adaptability” must be measured as **conditional performance stability** and **controlled response** to regime changes.

#### 5.1 Regime definitions: you need a standardized protocol, not one model
Your standard should allow multiple regime engines, but require:
- disclosure of features, frequency, training window, and update frequency
- out-of-sample regime labeling where possible (avoid refitting that leaks future structure)

Common regime methods include:
- clustering/mixture models (GMM) [[33]](https://macrosynergy.com/research/classifying-market-regimes/), [[34]](https://www.twosigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Regime-Modeling_.pdf)
- HMMs for latent state inference [[38]](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/market-regime-detection-using-hidden-markov-models-in-qstrader/), [[39]](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/13/12/311)
- heavy-tail mixture + volatility dynamics (t-mixture + GARCH) [[37]](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/assets/pdf/global/pc/2025/decoding-market-regimes-with-machine-learning.pdf)

A practical standard: require **two regime taxonomies**:
1) **Volatility/liquidity regime** (fast/slow markets; liquid/illiquid) — strongly linked to execution and drawdown behavior [[37]](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/assets/pdf/global/pc/2025/decoding-market-regimes-with-machine-learning.pdf), [[40]](https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/wp/2019/wpiea2019250-print-pdf.pdf), [[43]](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.22113v1)  
2) **Macro/market condition regime** (expansion/decline/turmoil) — more interpretability [[37]](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/assets/pdf/global/pc/2025/decoding-market-regimes-with-machine-learning.pdf), [[35]](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11499v2)

#### 5.2 Conditional performance attribution
For each regime, report:
- return distribution, drawdowns, ES/CVaR, and exposure shifts
- “hit rate” (fraction of positive periods) if relevant

Practitioner regime work shows how regime labeling helps interpret performance and uncertainty (e.g., regime-conditional dispersion/reliability measures) [[37]](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/assets/pdf/global/pc/2025/decoding-market-regimes-with-machine-learning.pdf).

#### 5.3 Stress testing: correlations and liquidity can shift discontinuously
Require standardized stress tests, including:
- **correlation stress** (correlation matrices are not stable; stress scenarios matter) [[41]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268122004061)
- **liquidity regime switch** scenarios: market liquidity can jump from high-liquidity to low-liquidity regimes and amplify fire-sale dynamics [[40]](https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/wp/2019/wpiea2019250-print-pdf.pdf)

This matters for strategies that appear diversified in calm regimes but fail in turbulence.

---

### Pillar 6 — Research integrity & validation (anti-overfitting as a first-class metric)

A cross-strategy benchmark that doesn’t enforce research integrity will rank “best backtests,” not best strategies.

#### 6.1 Required validation layers

**Layer 1: Out-of-sample testing (minimum)**
- Walk-forward is common but is “single-path” and can have high variance [[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purged_cross-validation).

**Layer 2: Leakage control for ML/label overlap**
- Purging and embargoing address label overlap and temporal leakage; embargo removes post-test contamination windows [[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purged_cross-validation), [[25]](https://www.quantresearch.org/Innovations.htm).

**Layer 3: Distribution of OOS outcomes**
- CPCV generates many backtest paths and gives a distribution of OOS performance, not a single estimate [[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purged_cross-validation). Implementations exist in tooling (e.g., mlfinlab classes) though exact mechanics must be verified in your environment [[26]](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/blob/master/mlfinlab/cross_validation/combinatorial.py).

#### 6.2 Data snooping / multiple testing correction
A standard should require at least one of:
- **White’s Reality Check** for specification searches to test whether the best-performing model is genuinely superior vs benchmark under data snooping [[22]](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/718/White2000.pdf)  
- Multiple testing-aware Sharpe haircuts (Harvey & Liu) rather than ad-hoc “50% haircut” rules; haircuts are nonlinear and depend on number of tests [[53]](https://people.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P120_Backtesting.PDF)  
- Deflated Sharpe / probabilistic Sharpe concepts explicitly correcting for selection bias and non-normality [[17]](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbpapers/deflated-sharpe.pdf)

This must be paired with a required disclosure: **number of trials** (or an auditable proxy). SBAI explicitly asks investors to inquire about how many trials and what governance prevents overfitting [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf).

#### 6.3 Backtest realism requirements
SBAI’s checklist aligns well with what should be mandatory:
- clear labeling of hypothetical results
- separation of backtest vs live
- realistic assumptions about tradeability, delay/slippage, costs, financing, stock lending fees [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf)
- governance (e.g., committee oversight) [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf)

Event-based backtesting is strongly preferred for intraday; vector backtests often ignore partial fills, spreads, and intrabar path dependence [[31]](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-quant-news/a-practical-breakdown-of-vector-based-vs-event-based-backtesting/). Slippage/liquidity models must be explicit and parameterized [[32]](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/blob/master/zipline/finance/slippage.py).

---

## 4) The Quant Strategy Scorecard (QSS): how to integrate everything

A single scalar “score” is dangerous. You want a **scorecard + Pareto frontier** approach:

### 4.1 Output format: three layers

**Layer A — Summary (human-readable):**  
- A one-page table of headline metrics under standardized assumptions

**Layer B — Diagnostic panels (for comparability):**  
- Risk decomposition, exposure decomposition, regime-conditional tables, cost/capacity curves

### 4.2 A minimal QSS metric set (practical and defensible)

Below is a “minimum viable standard” that can cover multi-factor, stat arb, trend, options/vol, and HFT/MM.

#### Section 1: Performance (3 lines)
- Net annualized return (with compounding method)
- Max drawdown; average drawdown duration (if available)

- Model update frequency and retraining rules (to avoid hidden look-ahead)

#### Section 7: Research integrity (required disclosures)

### 4.3 Aggregation: how to rank without pretending there’s one “true” score

You have two viable approaches:

#### Approach 1: Pareto-front comparison (recommended default)
- Treat the scorecard as a point in a multidimensional space:
  - return, ES(99), max DD, IS cost, capacity, regime robustness, research integrity
- Identify nondominated strategies (Pareto frontier).
This avoids arbitrary weights and reduces gaming.

#### Approach 2: Weighted composite score (only with explicit user utility)
If you must output a single number:
- Require the evaluator to specify a utility function or weights:
  - e.g., penalize ES and drawdown more than volatility
  - impose hard constraints (e.g., ES(99) < threshold; drawdown < threshold)
This is consistent with the idea that risk preferences differ and are not “universal.”

## 5) Practical implementation steps (how you would actually build this)

### Step 1 — Define the “Strategy Evaluation Contract”
A standard template (like AIMA DDQ but quantitative) [[4]](https://www.aima.org/sound-practices/due-diligence-questionnaires.html):
- instrument universe
- data frequency and timestamps
- cost model
- financing assumptions
- leverage/margin constraints
- rebalancing/execution rules
- evaluation period and OOS protocol
- regime engine and regime labels

### Step 2 — Build a two-engine backtest stack
- **Research backtester**: fast iteration, but must log every trial and configuration (for multiple testing accounting) [[17]](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbpapers/deflated-sharpe.pdf), [[53]](https://people.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P120_Backtesting.PDF)  
- **Production-like simulator**: event-based for intraday, explicit order/fill events [[31]](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-quant-news/a-practical-breakdown-of-vector-based-vs-event-based-backtesting/), explicit slippage and liquidity limits [[32]](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/blob/master/zipline/finance/slippage.py)

### Step 3 — Enforce validation gates
- Purged/embargoed CV for ML labels [[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purged_cross-validation), [[25]](https://www.quantresearch.org/Innovations.htm)
- CPCV for distribution of OOS performance [[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purged_cross-validation)
- Reality-check / multiple testing adjusted significance [[22]](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/718/White2000.pdf), [[53]](https://people.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P120_Backtesting.PDF)
- Reject strategies whose apparent skill disappears after adjustment

### Step 4 — Produce the QSS + audit package
- Human-readable scorecard
- Machine-readable metadata and reproducibility package (conceptually aligned with prescriptive reporting + record retention ideas seen in regulated measurement regimes) [[54]](https://dart.deloitte.com/USDART/home/accounting/sec/rules-regulations/255-proprietary-trading-certain-interests-in/appendix-a-reporting-recordkeeping-requirement-for)

### Step 5 — Version your assumptions with market structure
Because tick/fee rules and execution-quality reporting standards are changing:
- maintain versioned cost and tick-size regimes (SEC changes and shifting compliance dates show this matters) [[58]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-137), [[60]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-130-sec-issues-exemptive-order-regarding-compliance-certain-rules-under-regulation-nms)
- incorporate Rule 605-style execution-quality definitions where relevant [[55]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-32)
- venue fragmentation segmentation (off-exchange dominance) [[61]](https://www.cboe.com/insights/posts/2025-u-s-equities-year-in-review/)
- for crypto, include venue reliability and effective spread/IS as primary liquidity measures [[62]](https://www.bitgo.com/resources/blog/crypto-liquidity/)

## 6) Key “non-negotiables” to make it credible as a standard

If you want this to be accepted as a benchmark-like framework (not just another internal rubric), these are essential:

1) **Clear separation of actual vs hypothetical performance** (and ideally stop showing backtests once live history is meaningful) [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf), [[51]](https://www.gipsstandards.org/standards/gips-standards-for-firms/gips-standards-handbook-for-firms/)  
2) **Mandatory disclosure of search scope / trials** (or an auditable proxy) [[17]](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbpapers/deflated-sharpe.pdf), [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf)  
3) **Multiple testing-aware skill assessment** (Reality Check or equivalent; no “raw Sharpe worship”) [[22]](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/718/White2000.pdf), [[53]](https://people.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P120_Backtesting.PDF)  
4) **Serial correlation and smoothing diagnostics** (Sharpe and correlations can be structurally biased otherwise) [[13]](https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/research/financial-analysts-journal/2002/the-statistics-of-sharpe-ratios), [[15]](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9571)  
5) **Explicit execution benchmarks and cost models** (implementation shortfall / arrival price) [[45]](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/finread/impshort.pdf)  
6) **Microstructure metrics for HFT/MM** (effective/realized spreads and adverse selection) [[46]](https://www.sec.gov/files/dera_wp_tick_size-market_quality.pdf)  
7) **Regime-conditioned reporting** using disclosed and stable regime protocols [[33]](https://macrosynergy.com/research/classifying-market-regimes/), [[34]](https://www.twosigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Regime-Modeling_.pdf), [[37]](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/assets/pdf/global/pc/2025/decoding-market-regimes-with-machine-learning.pdf), [[39]](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/13/12/311)  
8) **Auditability and consistent policies** (GIPS-like discipline around policies, disclosures, and avoiding misleading performance linkage) [[51]](https://www.gipsstandards.org/standards/gips-standards-for-firms/gips-standards-handbook-for-firms/)

---

## 7) What this enables (and what it won’t)

### Enables
- Apples-to-apples comparison across:
  - factor L/S vs trend vs vol selling vs stat arb
  - discretionary-looking systematic overlays (if rules disclosed)
  - HFT/MM vs lower-frequency strategies via execution-cost and microstructure decomposition

### Won’t magically solve
- Proprietary opacity: regulators note that excessive granularity can reduce comparability and reveal proprietary strategies [[8]](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d529.pdf). Your standard must strike a balance: enough disclosure to compare, not so much that it forces IP leakage.
- True “capacity” as a single number: capacity is regime- and venue-dependent. You’ll report capacity *curves* and scenario dependence, not a universal scalar.

---

## 8) A concise “starter spec” you can adopt immediately

If you want a practical first version (v1.0) that is already materially better than most industry practice:

1) Require **QSS** with pillars 1–6 above, plus audit package  
2) Mandate:
   - ES(95/99) [[16]](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~rtr/papers/rtr179-CVaR1.pdf)
   - drawdown stats [[10]](https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/fileadmin/indices_feeds/ti_screen/index.html)
   - serial correlation + Sharpe annualization disclosure [[13]](https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/research/financial-analysts-journal/2002/the-statistics-of-sharpe-ratios)
   - implementation shortfall vs arrival price [[45]](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/finread/impshort.pdf)
   - multiple testing adjustment (Harvey–Liu or Reality Check) [[53]](https://people.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P120_Backtesting.PDF), [[22]](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/718/White2000.pdf)
   - backtest/live separation + realistic costs/financing/borrow assumptions [[52]](https://www.sbai.org/static/a7fc0b57-9c84-4b72-adae25e4bfae1be2/ARP-Backtesting.pdf)
3) For HFT/MM, mandate:
   - effective spread, realized spread, price impact [[46]](https://www.sec.gov/files/dera_wp_tick_size-market_quality.pdf)
   - time-to-execution distributions aligned with modern expectations for fine timing granularity [[55]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-32)
4) Add regime reporting with one standard engine (e.g., mixture/HMM) and disclose training/updates [[37]](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/assets/pdf/global/pc/2025/decoding-market-regimes-with-machine-learning.pdf), [[39]](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/13/12/311)

---

If you tell me which strategy classes you care about most (e.g., equity L/S factors + options overlays + intraday stat arb), I can propose a concrete **QSS schema** (field-by-field), recommended default horizons (daily vs monthly), and a reference implementation approach (including how to unify execution metrics so HFT/MM and slow strategies compare on the same economic “cost per risk” footing).
