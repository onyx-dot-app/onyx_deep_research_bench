ANSWER:
### 1) Scaling architectures: what’s proposed, what each one *really* requires, and where each is strongest/weakest

#### A. **QCCD / multi-zone segmented traps with ion shuttling (the “ion-trap workhorse” scaling path)**
**Core idea.** Keep *small* ion chains (or small crystals) where gates are easiest/highest fidelity, and scale system size by **moving ions between dedicated zones** (memory, processing, measurement, loading) using DC electrode waveforms—effectively a quantum “routing fabric.” This is the canonical **quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD)** vision [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01293).

**Why it scales better than a single long chain.**
- Long 1D chains become harder to control because mode spectra crowd and gate speeds and calibration complexity worsen; one scaling heuristic used in compilation/scheduling work is gate-rate degradation with ion number (e.g., decreasing roughly with chain length) and increased sensitivity to low-frequency noise when traps are softened to avoid structural instabilities [[64]](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14065v2), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11550402/).
- QCCD avoids that by capping ions per interaction region and using transport for connectivity [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01293).

**Key technical assumptions / resource requirements.**
1. **Fast, low-heating transport (including junctions).** Reliable junction transport with low motional excitation has been demonstrated (e.g., through an X-junction) while preserving internal-state coherence and adding only a few motional quanta, but this relies on careful waveform design and noise control [[4]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.153002).  
2. **Lots of electrodes and high-channel-count control.** QCCD typically needs *more electrodes than qubits* (often cited as ~10 electrodes per qubit in current designs), which creates a severe “wiring/I/O problem” if naively implemented with one DAC per electrode [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040313), [[38]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01815v2).  
3. **Parallel optical (or microwave) control across zones** and *automation* to keep calibration manageable across many zones [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01293), [[41]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14065).  
4. **High-throughput loading/reloading** so ion loss doesn’t halt the machine (see bottlenecks section).

**Where QCCD is already compelling (evidence).**
- A programmable QCCD-style system integrating a scalable trap, parallel optical delivery, and fast ion transport has been demonstrated, with system-level benchmarks like teleported CNOT characterization and Quantum Volume reported in that framework [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01293).  
- Integrated photonics has now been shown to support **transport + coherent multizone operations** in photonics-integrated traps, including transport between zones and simultaneous low-crosstalk operations in separate zones—explicitly positioned as a basis for scaling QCCD [[20]](https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040), [[31]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040).  
- Software tooling for QCCD shuttling schedules and compilation is emerging to reduce transport time steps under decoherence constraints [[41]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14065), [[64]](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14065v2).

**Main scaling risk.** QCCD is “engineerable,” but scaling pressure concentrates into (i) electrode control distribution (vacuum feedthrough count, cryo interface), (ii) transport time + recooling overheads, (iii) trap surface noise/heating, and (iv) automation/calibration burden.

---

#### B. **2D surface-electrode arrays for routing/sorting (grid-based QCCD variants)**
**Core idea.** Instead of mostly-linear shuttling paths, use **2D grids** to reduce routing congestion and enable faster “sorting” primitives.

**Why it matters.** As you push toward hundreds/thousands of qubits, *traffic management* becomes a first-order performance constraint: you need to get the right ions to the right zones without serialized bottlenecks.

**Evidence / demonstrations.**
- Quantinuum has described (in a technical blog tied to a paper) a grid trap with a “swap-or-stay” primitive for rearrangement and sorting, reporting reproducible operation across multiple systems and ion species pairs, and reporting a **2.5 kHz swap rate** with low heating in that demonstration context [[36]](https://www.quantinuum.com/blog/quantinuum-researchers-make-a-huge-leap-forward-demonstrating-the-scalability-of-the-qccd-architecture-solving-the-wiring-problem). (This is a company communication, but it’s still a concrete scaling-oriented design + metric.)

**Main scaling risk.** 2D routing reduces scheduling bottlenecks but can increase electrode count and complexity (again pushing wiring/control integration to the forefront).

---

#### C. **“Larger crystal” approaches: 2D ion crystals as a single-module scale-up**
**Core idea.** Scale qubits within *one trap* by trapping **2D crystals** (instead of 1D chains), leveraging long-range Coulomb coupling for connectivity, potentially reaching “hundreds to thousands of qubits” in one module (as envisioned by proponents) [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11550402/).

**What’s improved recently.**
- A 2024 experiment demonstrated **individually addressed two-qubit entangling gates between arbitrary pairs** in a 2D crystal (4 ions), with sub-0.1% addressing crosstalk using crossed AOD beam steering and a gate sequence addressing one ion at a time to avoid multi-beam interference/crosstalk issues [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11550402/). It also showed micromotion effects could be compensated by recalibrating intensity without degrading fidelity in that regime [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11550402/).

**The hard truth for fault-tolerant scaling.**
- 2D crystals have **intrinsic long-range coupling**, which is a double-edged sword: it gives connectivity but introduces **parallel-gate crosstalk** that directly impacts QEC. A 2025 analysis of rotated surface code operation in 2D crystals finds crosstalk/parallelism tradeoffs can force **larger code distances** than previously assumed (e.g., distance-5 needed rather than distance-3 under modeled crosstalk) to correct two-qubit crosstalk errors [[17]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/c7w3-pxls).  
- Also, 2D crystals inherently involve micromotion (depending on geometry), plus challenging 2D optical addressing and calibration scaling [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11550402/).

**Where 2D crystals might win.**
- As a *medium-scale “fat module”* (tens to low hundreds of qubits) if parallelism/crosstalk can be tamed and if control delivery becomes highly integrated (integrated photonics + stable beam steering).  
- Less convincing as the sole path to “thousands+” *fault-tolerant* qubits without modularization, because QEC requires massive parallelism with tightly bounded correlated errors [[17]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/c7w3-pxls).

---

#### D. **Coupled-subregister lattice architectures (e.g., “Quantum Spring Array”)**
**Core idea.** Build a 2D lattice where each site contains a **1D ion string subregister**, and couple neighboring subregisters by bringing strings close enough to interact *without merging chains* (reducing the need for junction shuttling and chain split/merge operations) [[6]](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.02406v1).

**What’s been demonstrated.**
- Experiments with Ca⁺ in double-well potentials explored coupling along axial and radial directions and reported an entangled state between qubits in separate trapping regions along the radial axis, positioned as a first for that geometry [[6]](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.02406v1). The work argues favorable scaling of coupling rates with ion count per string in some regimes and maps the architecture to fault-tolerant code primitives [[6]](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.02406v1).

**Feasibility verdict.**
- Promising conceptually as a way to reduce the hardest QCCD primitives (junctions, split/merge), but it introduces **RF-control complexity** (radial shuttling requires controlling RF null displacement) and demands precise multi-well stability and calibration across a 2D lattice [[6]](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.02406v1).  
- Still earlier-stage than mainstream QCCD and modular networking; likely to be explored in parallel as a “next-gen trap fabric,” not the near-term mainline for large-scale machines.

---

#### E. **3D / multilayer trap arrays and alternative confinement (including Penning-QCCD direction)**
**3D multilayer arrays.** A multilayer trapped-ion array with up to **13 trapping sites** demonstrated automated loading and shuttling with >0.99999 success rate and coherence preservation during shuttling [[7]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.L050601), [[8]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05741). This is a meaningful reliability datapoint for “many-site” arrays.

**Penning microtrap arrays (static fields) as a scaling alternative.**
- RF Paul trap arrays face power dissipation and micromotion alignment constraints that may become severe in very large arrays; a Penning-trap QCCD concept is motivated partly by avoiding RF dissipation and enabling flexible 3D transport without specialized junction overhead [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07111-x).  
- A cryogenic microfabricated surface-electrode Penning trap demonstrated single-ion control and low-heating 2D transport with negligible motional heating in that setup, but requires a **multi-tesla magnetic field** and cryogenic UHV infrastructure [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07111-x).

**Feasibility verdict.**
- Penning-QCCD is intriguing for *array density* and transport flexibility, but the required magnetic-field infrastructure and the maturity of high-fidelity multi-qubit gates in such microtrap arrays make it more speculative for near-term fault-tolerant computing (vs. Paul-trap QCCD where the ecosystem is far more mature).

---

#### F. **Modular architectures: photonic interconnects (and “matter-links”) connecting multiple ion-trap QPUs**
This is the dominant “beyond-one-chip” scaling storyline: instead of forcing everything onto one monolith, build **many high-quality modules** and interconnect them.

##### F1. Photonic modular interconnects
**Core idea.** Use **heralded remote entanglement** between “network qubits” in different modules using photons, then consume those Bell pairs to implement deterministic remote gates via **teleportation** [[45]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08404-x), [[12]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0391).

**What’s been demonstrated (relevant 2024–2026 metrics).**
- **Distributed trapped-ion quantum computing across modules:** deterministic teleportation of a remote CZ gate between modules separated by ~2 m with **86% fidelity**, and a distributed Grover demonstration with **71% success** [[45]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08404-x).  
- **High-fidelity remote entanglement via time-bin photons:** Bell-state fidelity **0.970(4)** between two remote trapped-ion qubits (Ba⁺) using time-bin encoding, explicitly motivated as more robust than polarization to fiber birefringence [[46]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57557-4).  
- **Metropolitan-scale multiplexing:** ion–photon entanglement over **12 km fiber** using up to **44 time-bin modes**, achieving **4.28 s⁻¹** heralded ion–photon entanglement success, with reported memory coherence time **366 ms** exceeding entanglement generation time in that framework [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5).  
- **Kilometer-scale temporal multiplexed ion–ion entanglement:** over **1.2 km fiber**, strict-heralding time-bin multiplexing (10 modes) reported **95.9 ± 1.5%** ion–ion entanglement fidelity and **4.59×** efficiency enhancement vs single-mode [[49]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20392v1).  
- **Integrated photonic routing with frequency conversion:** routing ion photons through a foundry SiN PIC using quantum frequency conversion, reporting **31% total transmission** and programmable switching/beam splitting—a key building block for scalable network photonics [[13]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08048), [[14]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.19.034001).  
- **Telecom frequency conversion compatible with long (µs) photons:** 606→1552 nm conversion with ~**25% device efficiency** and **SNR > 460** for 10 µs, ~single-photon pulses using narrow filtering—highly relevant to making ion networking telecom-compatible, especially with cavity-enhanced/narrowband emitters [[51]](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.15193v2).  
- **Integrated collection optics milestone (2026):** collecting an ion’s fluorescence into a trap-integrated **single-mode waveguide** (Sr⁺), positioned as a key ingredient for scalable entanglement generation and/or integrated detection, though the excerpted text does not provide a single-number collection efficiency [[50]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-025-02138-9).

**Practical bottleneck.** Photonic links are still **probabilistic and loss-limited**, and for fault-tolerant networking the raw entanglement rate can be substantially reduced by switching/conversion/distillation overhead (one analysis argues ~100× effective rate reduction) [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3). At metro distances, round-trip heralding delays impose a hard latency floor (e.g., ≥100 µs attempt period for 10 km), requiring multiplexing and memory protection to keep rates above decoherence [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[49]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20392v1).

##### F2. Deterministic “matter-links” between adjacent chips/modules (a different modularity axis)
A striking alternative demonstration moved actual ions between microchip modules:
- A “quantum matter-link” transferred ions between two microchip modules at **2424 s⁻¹** over **684 µm**, with ion-loss-related infidelity **< 7×10⁻⁸** [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).  
This has radically better *raw connection operation rate* than long-distance photonics, but it requires physically adjacent modules with aligned electrodes and compatible trapping potentials across gaps [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).

**Feasibility verdict (modularity overall).**
- **Photonic links** look most plausible for *data-center-scale* modularity and very large systems, but need major improvements in collection efficiency, multiplexing, and network-stack engineering to support fault-tolerant clock rates.  
- **Matter-links** may become attractive for *rack-scale or multi-chip packages* where modules are physically close, potentially complementing photonics (short-range deterministic links + long-range photonics).

---

### 2) Gate-generation approaches and how they scale (fidelity, speed, parallelism, cross-talk, and hardware burden)

#### A. **Laser-mediated Mølmer–Sørensen (MS) / Raman gates (mainstream today)**
**Strengths.**
- Best-established high-fidelity two-qubit gates in many trapped-ion platforms; robust to long distances within a chain via shared modes; compatible with QCCD (gate zones) and also with modest 2D crystals [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11550402/).

**Scaling pain points.**
1. **Optical delivery complexity scales badly** with qubit count if done in free space: alignment, beam pointing, AOM/AOD channels, stability, and calibration all scale with the number of individually addressed sites [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j).  
2. **Crosstalk during simultaneous operations** becomes a central limiter for QEC-level parallelism. A 2024 experiment demonstrated a frequency-offset method that reduced phase-dependent optical interference crosstalk dramatically (neighbor fractional rotation error reduced from 0.185(4) to ≤0.006) during simultaneous single-qubit Raman gates, and proposed composite sequences for phase-agnostic MS operation [[18]](https://www.osti.gov/pages/biblio/2311278).  
3. In 2D crystals, long-range coupling also creates **intrinsic parallel-gate crosstalk** that may force reduced parallelism or larger code distances [[17]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/c7w3-pxls).

**Integrated photonics as a scaling enabler for lasers (but not “free”).**
- Integrated delivery can eliminate much free-space complexity, but introduces new engineering constraints: dielectric charging, waveguide losses, thermal issues, and multi-wavelength integration [[20]](https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040), [[21]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47882-5), [[31]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040).  
- A 2024 multi-site integrated photonics demonstration delivered all required wavelengths (UV to NIR) to three Yb⁺ ions in separate wells at room temperature, but estimated **~49 dB launch-to-ion loss** for a 435 nm path and reported **π-times ≥130 µs**, highlighting that loss/power handling is a real scaling limiter unless coupling and propagation losses are dramatically improved (e.g., edge coupling) [[21]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47882-5).  
- A 2025 PRX multizone integrated-photonics trap demonstrated coherent operations in multiple zones, transport between zones, and low-crosstalk simultaneous control, while explicitly having to mitigate exposed dielectric effects on transport/heating [[20]](https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040), [[31]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040).

**Where laser/MS gates likely remain best.**
- Near-term and medium-term, especially for QCCD modules where high gate fidelity is paramount and the hardware stack is mature. Expect a hybrid: lasers for entangling gates + increasing use of integrated photonics and/or beam-steering to reduce alignment overhead.

---

#### B. **Microwave / RF / near-field magnetic-gradient gates (the “all-electronic coherent control” scaling play)**
**Core promise.** Replace laser-based coherent control with chip-integrated currents and magnetic gradients. This directly targets the biggest system-integration headache: scaling optical control hardware [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j).

**Best recent evidence (scaling-relevant).**
- An “electronically controlled trapped-ion quantum computer” architecture demonstrated **site-selective** gates in a **seven-zone** trap controlling up to **10 qubits**, reporting:
  - single-qubit fidelity **99.99916(7)%**
  - two-qubit maximally entangled state fidelity **99.97(1)%**
  - long-term stable performance and low crosstalk across the device (as reported) [[9]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07694), [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j), [[23]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07694v1).  
This is one of the most compelling *engineering* demonstrations because it combines: multi-zone structure, selectivity, and extremely high fidelities without requiring laser beams for coherent control [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j).

**Speed and robustness trends.**
- A 2025 “laser-free” universal entangling gate using RF control plus static magnetic gradients reported an approach that is *simpler to scale* (single phase-modulated RF per ion), with strong dynamical decoupling benefits (3 orders of magnitude coherence increase vs bare qubits) and an order-of-magnitude speedup vs earlier static-gradient RF gates (exact numeric gate times/fidelities are not present in the excerpt) [[24]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021079).  
- A 2025 “smooth gate” approach (preprint) argues for **high-fidelity two-qubit gates without ground-state cooling**, claiming estimated error **8.4(7)×10⁻⁵** and robustness up to mean phonon number ~9.4 on the gate mode (≤5×10⁻⁴ error claimed), implying less need for recooling and therefore better throughput in QCCD-like machines [[25]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17286), [[26]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.17286v1). (The “highest fidelity ever across modalities” phrasing is an author claim and shouldn’t be taken as independently established from these sources alone [[26]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.17286v1).)

**Scaling upside.**
- Electronics and RF distribution can, in principle, scale using semiconductor packaging and multiplexing; DC tuning electrodes can be multiplexed efficiently [[23]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07694v1), [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j).  
- Reduced dependence on complex multi-wavelength optical delivery for gates.

**Scaling downside.**
- You still need lasers for loading/state preparation/measurement in most systems [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j).  
- Engineering very uniform, stable gradients and managing microwave cross-coupling in dense arrays remains nontrivial.  
- The ecosystem for large, fully integrated RF-control stacks is younger than for lasers—though progressing rapidly.

**Most plausible role.**
- A leading candidate for “manufacturable” large-scale modules because it turns the scaling problem into something closer to RFIC/packaging—areas where industry is strong—while retaining trapped-ion fidelity advantages [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j).

---

#### C. **Fast gates (ultrafast pulsed “kick” gates)**
**Core promise.** Increase gate speed dramatically (100 kHz–MHz regimes), and ideally reduce the scaling penalty of large crystals/chains.

**State of evidence in the provided sources.**
- Recent work cited here is largely theoretical: one 2025 study claims nonlocal fast gates between arbitrary pairs in chains up to ~40 ions at 100 kHz–1 MHz logic rates under modeled conditions, with pulse-error requirements weakly dependent on chain length [[29]](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.11385v1).  
- Mixed-species fast-gate proposals similarly emphasize ultrafast pulsed lasers and identify ultrafast single-qubit control errors as a primary limitation [[30]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/gyls-g198).

**Scaling assessment.**
- If experimentally validated at high fidelity, fast gates could reduce idle/memory errors and increase QEC cycle rates, but the hardware stack (ultrafast lasers, pulse shaping, timing, cross-talk control) is itself a major scaling challenge.  
- Near-term: less likely than QCCD+MS or all-electronic gates for the first large fault-tolerant systems; longer-term: potentially valuable as an accelerator once integration maturity increases.

---

### 3) Dominant scaling bottlenecks and the most credible mitigation directions (2024–2026 emphasis)

#### A. Motional heating (especially “anomalous” surface noise) and motional dephasing
**Why it matters.** Heating degrades entangling gates (which rely on motional modes) and makes fast low-error transport difficult.

**What recent work says about root causes and mitigation.**
- Detailed heating/dephasing characterization in multi-material surface traps finds that measured technical noise contributions (RF drive noise, DC electrode noise, residual laser leakage) can be orders of magnitude below observed heating, supporting the view that **surface adsorbates/dynamics** dominate in those devices [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12731349/).  
- In-situ surface treatments (e.g., argon-ion treatment / sputtering) are actively investigated as mitigation pathways [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12731349/).  
- Practical trap engineering measures include: micromotion minimization (since RF noise couples through micromotion sidebands when displaced from the RF null) and aggressive filtering/noise control [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12731349/), [[35]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.04946v1).

**Scaling implication.** For thousands of qubits, you need (i) reproducibly low-heating surfaces at wafer scale, (ii) stable compensation of stray fields across many zones, and (iii) transport waveforms that do not inject excess energy.

---

#### B. Stray fields, dielectric charging, and integrated-component side effects
- Integrated photonics introduces **exposed dielectric surfaces** through electrode cutouts/windows; a multizone integrated-photonics trap explicitly reports developing techniques to measure and mitigate dielectric effects to achieve low-excitation transport and coherent multizone control [[20]](https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040), [[31]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040).  
- Substrate choice matters: silicon enables CMOS-compatible integration but brings **RF loss** (heating) and **free-carrier generation** under stray light due to its small bandgap—leading to time-varying fields and potential trap instability [[34]](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qute.202500412). A fused-silica multi-metal trap demonstrated industrial fabrication, cryo-compatible sensors down to 10 K, wafer testing, and improved performance vs similar silicon-based designs in that report [[34]](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qute.202500412).

**Scaling implication.** The “integration tax” is real: adding photonics/electronics can degrade the trap environment unless materials, shielding, and charging mitigation are engineered from the start.

---

#### C. Wiring, electronics I/O, and waveform generation at scale (often the *dominant* bottleneck)
**Why it’s existential.** Large QCCD chips could require ~10,000 electrode controls for ~1000 qubits if done naively, beyond practical vacuum feedthroughs and packaging [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040313), [[38]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01815v2).

**Most credible mitigation approaches.**
1. **Integrated switching / reduced-I/O electrode addressing.** WISE proposes integrating simple switching electronics to reduce I/O drastically—claiming a 1000-qubit fully connected machine could operate with ~200 signal sources, turning the scaling challenge into switching + transport control [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040313).  
2. **Time-division multiplexed DAC architectures.** A multiplexing approach proposes a single high-speed DAC feeding many electrodes with sample-and-hold demultiplexing, projecting control of **10,000 electrodes** using **13 FPGAs and 104 high-speed DACs** under realistic assumptions (focused on adiabatic transport regimes) [[38]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01815v2). A related experimental demonstration trapped an ion using time-division multiplexed DACs (title-level evidence in APL) [[39]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/23/234001/3374333/Trapping-an-atomic-ion-using-time-division).  
3. **Architectural reduction of analog lines.** Grid-based approaches describe using a fixed number of analog signals plus per-qubit digital inputs to reduce scaling of expensive analog channels [[36]](https://www.quantinuum.com/blog/quantinuum-researchers-make-a-huge-leap-forward-demonstrating-the-scalability-of-the-qccd-architecture-solving-the-wiring-problem).

**Scaling implication.** Expect the winning architectures to combine (i) aggressive multiplexing/switching, (ii) local in-vacuum electronics where feasible, and (iii) software-defined waveform control with automated calibration.

#### D. Transport overhead (time budget) and recooling
Even in strong QCCD demonstrations, transport and follow-up cooling can dominate runtime in some implementations (one cited context suggests overheads can reach extreme fractions of runtime) [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11550402/), and the broader literature emphasizes that large machines will require shuttling schedules minimizing steps due to decoherence [[41]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14065), [[64]](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14065v2).

**Mitigation directions.**
- Transport waveform optimization and scheduling/compilation that co-optimizes routing and gate placement [[41]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14065), [[64]](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14065v2).  
- Gate schemes less sensitive to temperature (e.g., “no ground-state cooling” electronic gates) could reduce recooling overhead substantially if validated broadly [[25]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17286), [[26]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.17286v1).

---

#### E. Ion loss/reload and compact sources
Large systems need *routine* reload without degrading electrodes or requiring bulky optics.
- A microfabricated atomic oven concept for integrated loading reports a **90×90 µm²** filament footprint, low-ms response time, milliwatt-scale power, and long lifetime projections, with packaging concepts compatible with backside loading slots [[37]](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/iqt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kumar-et-al-25.pdf).  
- Multi-site arrays also demonstrate extremely high shuttling success rates (>0.99999) in a 13-site 3D architecture [[7]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.L050601), [[8]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05741), suggesting transport reliability can be made excellent with the right engineering.

---

#### F. Thermal management (RF dissipation, substrate heating, cryo tradeoffs)
- RF losses in common substrates (e.g., silicon) can raise trap temperature; higher temperature can increase heating rates even in cryogenic setups [[34]](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qute.202500412).  
- Materials with better RF and thermal properties (e.g., AlN ceramics in a 3D trap overview) are explored, with reported low heating rates in some prototypes and emphasis on alignment, on-chip filters, and temperature sensors for in situ monitoring [[35]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.04946v1).  
- Cryogenic operation often improves noise but makes wiring/packaging harder; scaling will push toward designs that either (i) remain room-temperature with tight noise control, or (ii) use cryo with serious integration of electronics and thermal budgets.

### 4) Modular interconnect feasibility: photonics vs monolithic shuttling, with realistic throughput/latency comparisons

#### A. Photonic interconnect: what’s feasible now and what’s missing
**What’s solid now (as of the cited 2024–2026 results).**
- Remote entanglement fidelities around **96–97%** in multiple regimes, including time-bin encoding at **0.970(4)** [[46]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57557-4) and kilometer-scale demonstrations ~**95.9%** [[49]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20392v1).  
- Multiplexing demonstrably improves effective rates at distance: **4.28 s⁻¹** ion–photon entanglement success over **12 km** using up to 44 time bins [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5).  
- Deterministic distributed gates are already shown via teleportation once entanglement exists (teleported CZ at 86% fidelity across modules) [[45]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08404-x).

**What limits scale-up to large fault-tolerant distributed computers.**
1. **Rate vs memory decoherence:** you need entanglement generation *faster than* decoherence and fast enough to support QEC cycle rates across modules [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5).  
2. **Loss and collection efficiency:** improvements in in-vacuo optics, integrated collection [[50]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-025-02138-9), and routing/frequency conversion [[13]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08048), [[51]](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.15193v2) are essential.  
3. **Fault-tolerant network overhead:** distillation/purification and switching/frequency conversion stacks can reduce effective connection rate substantially (one analysis argues ~100× effective reduction) [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).  
4. **Latency floor:** round-trip heralding delay sets the attempt clock; multiplexing packs multiple attempts into the waiting window and is now experimentally demonstrated at both ~km and ~10 km scales [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[49]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20392v1).

**Likely endgame.** Photonic modularity is still the most credible path to *very large* systems (tens/hundreds of thousands of physical qubits and beyond), but only if integrated photonics + multiplexing + memory-protected repeat-until-success protocols become routine engineering, not bespoke lab setups [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[50]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-025-02138-9).

#### B. Shuttling-based scaling (monolithic QCCD) vs modular photonics: a practical comparison
**Monolithic QCCD advantages.**
- Deterministic connectivity via transport; no probabilistic links.  
- Strong performance in current commercial devices with full connectivity and mature gate sets [[5]](https://www.quantinuum.com/products-solutions/quantinuum-systems/system-model-h1) (vendor claim context) and strong logical-qubit demonstrations built on QCCD-style machines [[54]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02666), [[58]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16728).

**Monolithic QCCD limitations.**
- Chip size/fabrication limits and increasing electrode control complexity; large-scale single-device qubit counts may be constrained by manufacturable die size and routing density [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).  
- Wiring/control and calibration complexity grow steeply [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040313), [[38]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01815v2).

**Modular photonics advantages.**
- Physical separation of modules (data-center friendly); reconfigurable topology via photonic switching [[45]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08404-x).  
- Avoids forcing everything onto one electrode/control monolith.

**Modular photonics limitations.**
- Probabilistic entanglement generation and overhead for fault tolerance [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3), despite impressive progress in time-bin encoding and multiplexing [[46]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57557-4), [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[49]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20392v1).

**A realistic hybrid direction.**
- Many credible roadmaps implicitly converge on: **high-quality medium-sized modules** (QCCD internally) + **photonic interconnect** for cross-module scaling [[42]](https://www.ionq.com/roadmap), [[43]](https://www.ionq.com/blog/ionqs-accelerated-roadmap-turning-quantum-ambition-into-reality), [[45]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08404-x).  
- Add **short-range deterministic interposers** (matter-links) where physical adjacency is feasible, because kHz-class deterministic transport across module boundaries has been shown at sub-mm scales [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).

---

### 5) System integration challenges: what will make or break “thousands of ions” machines

#### A. Trap microfabrication yield and manufacturability
- Industrial fabrication plus automated wafer test is highlighted as a needed pathway to scale and reduce per-chip variability; a fused-silica multilayer trap work explicitly emphasizes industrial facility fabrication, wafer test, and cryo sensor validation [[34]](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qute.202500412).  
- Integration of photonics/electronics must be done without degrading trap noise (charging, RF loss) [[34]](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qute.202500412), [[31]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040).

#### B. Packaging, vacuum interfaces, and “getting signals in”
This is repeatedly identified as a central blocker:
- Vacuum/cryo feedthrough limits collide with per-electrode DAC assumptions in QCCD; multiplexing and switching are direct responses [[38]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01815v2), [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040313).  
- Companies describe miniaturized vacuum packages as a scaling enabler (investor-material claim) [[40]](https://s28.q4cdn.com/828571518/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/24-11-06-Investor-Updates-Q3-2024_vF.pdf). The key engineering reality is that packaging must co-design RF delivery, DC stability, thermal management, optical access, and maintainability.

#### C. Integrated optics: multi-wavelength delivery + crosstalk + loss + charging
- Multi-wavelength integrated delivery to multiple sites is demonstrated but currently can incur enormous loss in some implementations, slowing gates unless power handling and coupling are improved [[21]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47882-5).  
- Multizone integrated photonics is now real and supports transport and simultaneous low-crosstalk operations, but explicitly introduces dielectric compensation complexity [[20]](https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040), [[31]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040).  
- Integrated collection into single-mode waveguides is a key networking milestone (2026), but the system-level challenge is turning this into a high-efficiency, high-uniformity, wafer-scale component [[50]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-025-02138-9).

#### D. Calibration/automation and real-time feedback
- QCCD requires scheduling that respects transport conflicts and decoherence; heuristic scheduling tools exist and show near-minimal step scheduling in studies [[41]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14065), [[64]](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14065v2).  
- Logical operations already require **real-time decoding** and adaptive correction in leading trapped-ion demonstrations [[58]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16728), so scaling demands robust classical co-processors, streaming telemetry, and automated recalibration (the “control plane” becomes as important as the quantum plane).

---

### 6) Compatibility with fault-tolerant QEC and “real-world problems”: which strategies look most likely to succeed

A trapped-ion system “capable of solving real-world problems” almost certainly means **fault-tolerant quantum computing** (FTQC) with logical qubits, not just large-N NISQ. The practical question becomes: which scaling approach can deliver (i) enough physical qubits, (ii) sufficiently low correlated error, and (iii) enough parallelism/throughput to run deep circuits?

#### A. What trapped ions have already shown on logical qubits (2024–2025 highlights from sources)
1. **Beyond break-even logical entanglement.** A Quantinuum experiment encoded a GHZ state into **four logical qubits** using a Tanner-transformed long-range-enhanced surface code, reporting logical fidelity bounds **~99.5–99.7%** (postselecting >98% outcomes) versus **~97.8–98.7%** for an unencoded 4-physical-qubit GHZ [[54]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02666). This is an important “systems-level” indication that trapped-ion connectivity can support nonlocal code constructions and logical improvements.  
2. **Fault-tolerant teleportation + lattice surgery on a QEC code (distance-3 color code).** Logical teleportation circuits with real-time decoding and correction used up to **30 physical qubits**, reporting process fidelities around **0.975** (with a QEC gadget) and **0.989** (without it) for transversal teleportation variants in that work [[58]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16728). Lattice-surgery variants were also demonstrated, with lower fidelities in the full QEC setting and higher fidelities when postselected/analyzed as error detection [[58]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16728).  
3. **Mid-circuit measurement/reset in single species without shuttling.** A 2025 preprint reports in-situ MCMR with ~**2%** induced error on a data qubit (in a two-ion system) and projects a path below 0.1% with reduced laser noise, aiming to simplify architecture by avoiding shuttling for measurement isolation [[63]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12544).

**Implication.** The leading trapped-ion platforms are already operating in the regime where: real-time decoding, mid-circuit operations, and nontrivial logical circuits are in play—suggesting trapped ions are not blocked on “whether QEC works at all,” but rather on **how to scale it economically**.

---

#### B. Which scaling architectures best support QEC requirements (parallelism, locality assumptions, correlated error control)
**QEC “wants”:**
- high-fidelity 2-qubit gates,
- fast and reliable measurement/reset,
- massive parallel operations (syndrome extraction),
- predictable, local error structure (especially for surface-code-like methods),
- manageable correlated errors (crosstalk, shared-mode effects).

**How the strategies compare.**

1. **QCCD + small chains + transport-assisted locality (most compatible today).**
- QCCD naturally supports a *layout where syndrome extraction can be parallelized by allocating zones*, and it supports moving qubits to interaction regions rather than relying on long-range always-on couplings [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01293), [[64]](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14065v2).  
- It aligns well with **logical-qubit demonstrations** already performed on QCCD-based commercial systems [[54]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02666), [[58]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16728).  
- The big unknown is whether QCCD can achieve sufficiently fast cycle times at scale without transport/recooling dominating (and whether control multiplexing/switching can be made low-noise enough) [[38]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01815v2), [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040313).

2. **All-electronic gates + multi-zone traps (very promising for scalable QEC hardware).**
- If you can keep the ion-trap advantages but remove the optical-control scaling bottleneck, you make it easier to scale the number of concurrently operating zones/blocks.  
- The reported fidelities (single-qubit 99.99916(7)%, two-qubit Bell 99.97(1)%) in a multi-zone architecture are already in the regime relevant for pushing logical error rates down with practical overheads [[9]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07694), [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j).  
- The additional claimed direction—high fidelity without ground-state cooling—would directly reduce QCCD overhead if it generalizes, because cooling/transport overhead is frequently cited as a dominant time budget [[25]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17286), [[26]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.17286v1), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11550402/).

3. **2D crystals: QEC possible, but parallelism/crosstalk is the central risk.**
- The intrinsic coupling graph complicates clean parallel syndrome extraction; modeling suggests you may need larger code distances to compensate crosstalk under some conditions [[17]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/c7w3-pxls).  
- This doesn’t rule it out, but it makes the path to *efficient* FTQC less clear unless architectures can enforce effective locality or strongly suppress correlated errors.

4. **Photonic modularity: essential for very large scale, but likely *not* the first economical path to high-throughput QEC across many modules.**
- Current demonstrated remote entanglement and distributed-gate fidelities/rates are impressive but still far from “surface-code syndrome round across modules at high clock rate” unless you accept large overhead (lots of parallel links, heavy multiplexing, and possibly distillation) [[45]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08404-x), [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).  
- Photonics looks most viable as a **second-stage scaler**: once you have robust fault-tolerant modules, you network them for capacity.

5. **LDPC / nonlocal code approaches leveraging ion connectivity (potentially a major long-run advantage).**
- Trapped ions’ connectivity makes nonlocal stabilizer checks plausible. The “beyond break-even” demonstration explicitly frames itself as a step toward fault-tolerant computing with logical qubits in geometrically nonlocal LDPC-like constructions [[54]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02666).  
- Modeling work on LDPC-like codes for long ion chains argues these codes can reduce ancilla overhead (connectivity advantage) at the cost of longer syndrome extraction time due to reduced parallelism, highlighting a real throughput/overhead trade [[65]](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.22071v3).

---

### 7) So what are the *most effective* approaches to scaling from demos to real-world machines?

In practice, “most effective” means: **minimize total cost to reach fault-tolerant logical performance**, not just “maximize raw qubit count.” Based on the evidence and engineering bottlenecks reflected in the sources, the strongest path is not a single strategy but a *stack* that composes well.

#### Approach 1 (most likely near-to-mid term winner): **QCCD multi-zone scaling + aggressive control-electronics scaling + automation**
**Why it’s likely to succeed.**
- It is the most mature and has already delivered the deepest logical-qubit demonstrations among the cited results [[54]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02666), [[58]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16728).  
- Transport/junction primitives are known and have been experimentally validated as low-heating and coherence-preserving in key demonstrations [[4]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.153002).  
- The wiring/control bottleneck is being addressed directly via integrated switching (WISE) and time-division multiplexing concepts with explicit large-scale electrode-count analyses [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040313), [[38]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01815v2).  
- Scheduling/compilation research is directly tackling the “movement is expensive” reality [[41]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14065), [[64]](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14065v2).

**What must still be solved for thousands+.**
- Demonstrate *system-level* transport+gate throughput where QEC cycle times and algorithm depth are not dominated by shuttling/recooling.  
- Make multiplexed/switching control low-noise and robust enough for high-fidelity gates in the presence of large electrode networks [[38]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01815v2).  
- Industrialize trap surface noise mitigation and charging control across many zones [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12731349/), [[34]](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qute.202500412).

#### Approach 2 (highest leverage for manufacturable scale): **All-electronic coherent control (microwave/RF/gradient gates) inside multi-zone traps**
**Why it’s likely to succeed.**
- It directly attacks the biggest scaling pain of laser-based trapped-ion QC: coherent-control optical complexity [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j).  
- The demonstrated multi-zone, site-selective high fidelities are already excellent [[9]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07694), [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j).  
- If “high fidelity without ground-state cooling” continues to hold in broader settings, it could remove a major QCCD throughput bottleneck [[25]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17286), [[26]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.17286v1).

**What must still be solved.**
- Extend from ~10-qubit/7-zone demonstrations to much larger multi-zone systems while maintaining fidelity, stability, and low crosstalk [[9]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07694).  
- Engineer dense RF/microwave distribution, gradient uniformity, and calibration pipelines that scale.

**Most plausible outcome.** This becomes the “dominant module technology” (whether as a standalone or hybrid with lasers), because it maps better onto semiconductor-style manufacturability.

#### Approach 3 (long-run scaler): **Hybrid modularity: high-quality QCCD/electronic-control modules + photonic interconnects (plus multiplexing and integrated photonics)**
**Why it’s ultimately needed.**
- There are practical chip-size, electrode-count, and packaging limits to monoliths, motivating networks of modules [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).  
- Photonic interconnects are improving rapidly in fidelity, robustness (time-bin), multiplexing, and integrated routing/conversion [[46]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57557-4), [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[13]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08048), [[51]](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.15193v2).

**Why it’s not “the first” path to real-world advantage.**
- Rates and overheads remain a concern, especially once fault-tolerant networking overhead is included [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).  
- For many real-world problems, you need very fast, reliable logical operations—photonic links are getting there, but they likely trail intra-module operations for some time.

**Most likely successful form.**
- Use photonics primarily for **module-to-module entanglement distribution** and higher-level logical connectivity (e.g., between logical qubits or between error-corrected blocks), not for fine-grained syndrome extraction at the physical layer—unless entanglement generation rates increase by orders of magnitude and integration becomes extremely uniform [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).

### 8) Practical “most likely to succeed” ranking (with explicit caveats)

**1) QCCD-style multi-zone shuttling + electronics scaling (switching/multiplexing) + automation**  
Most proven end-to-end path today; directly aligned with existing logical-qubit progress [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01293), [[54]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02666), [[58]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16728), while addressing the core scaling bottleneck (wiring/control) via credible architectures [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040313), [[38]](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01815v2).

**2) All-electronic coherent control inside multi-zone architectures (often combined with QCCD transport)**  
Highest manufacturability leverage; excellent demonstrated fidelities in a scalable control paradigm [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j), [[9]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07694). If it scales to 100s of qubits per module with stable calibration, it may become the default module implementation.

**3) Hybrid modularity with photonic networking (plus multiplexing, integrated optics, and conversion)**  
Probably essential for “very large” systems, but still constrained by rate/overhead vs intra-module operations [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3). Progress is real and measurable (time-bin fidelity, km/12 km multiplexing rates, PIC routing, QFC) [[46]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57557-4), [[49]](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20392v1), [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[13]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08048), [[51]](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.15193v2).

**4) 2D crystals as monolithic scalers**  
Technically exciting and improving (pairwise gates, low addressing crosstalk) [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11550402/), but QEC parallelism/crosstalk and micromotion/addressing complexity make it a riskier primary route to large FTQC without additional architectural structure [[17]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/c7w3-pxls).

**5) Alternative arrays (QSA, Penning-QCCD)**  
Promising research directions, but less mature and/or require heavy infrastructure changes (e.g., Penning magnetic fields) [[6]](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.02406v1), [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07111-x).

---

### 9) What to watch over the next 1–3 years (the clearest “go/no-go” indicators)
1. **Demonstrated QEC cycle times and parallelism in multi-zone devices** (not just isolated high-fidelity gates). The lattice-surgery resource analysis emphasizes how strongly attainable rates depend on cycle times and coupling rates across separated regions [[61]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18764).

### Bottom line
The most effective scaling approach is converging toward a **layered architecture**:

- **Inside a module:** QCCD-style multi-zone operation (small chains, transport-based routing) [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01293), increasingly paired with **manufacturable control stacks**—either integrated photonics for lasers [[20]](https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011040), [[21]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47882-5), or more disruptively **all-electronic coherent control** with magnetic-gradient gates [[32]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/h4wk-v31j), [[9]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07694).  
- **Across modules:** photonic interconnects with **time-bin robustness**, **multiplexing**, **integrated routing**, and **frequency conversion** for telecom compatibility [[46]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57557-4), [[48]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67311-5), [[13]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08048), [[51]](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.15193v2)—augmented where possible by **deterministic short-range matter-links** in tightly integrated packages [[52]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35285-3).  
- **On the software/control plane:** scheduling/compilation and real-time decoding/feedback become mandatory components of the architecture, not optional extras [[41]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14065), [[58]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16728).

If forced to pick the single most likely near-term path to “large-scale systems capable of solving real-world problems,” it is: **QCCD multi-zone architectures with aggressively scaled electrode control (switching/multiplexing) and high-fidelity gates (increasingly all-electronic), reaching fault-tolerant logical performance within modules first—then modular photonic networking for further scale.**
