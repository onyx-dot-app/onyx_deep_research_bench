QUESTION:
Parkinson's disease has a profound impact on patients. What are the potential health warning signs associated with different stages of the disease? As family members, which specific signs should alert us to intervene or seek medical advice regarding the patient's condition? Furthermore, for patients who have undergone Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery, what daily life adjustments and support strategies can be implemented to improve their comfort and overall well-being?

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (6 total):
  #1: Research Parkinson’s disease staging frameworks (Hoehn & Yahr, MDS-UPDRS; early/mid/advanced) and compile typical symptom profiles by stage, emphasizing health warning signs and complications (motor and non-motor) that commonly emerge as disease advances.
  #2: Research caregiver-facing ‘when to intervene/seek medical advice’ thresholds in Parkinson’s disease: red-flag symptoms requiring emergency care vs same-day clinician contact vs routine follow-up; include falls, dysphagia/aspiration, delirium/psychosis, autonomic issues (orthostatic hypotension/syncope), infection triggers, medication adverse reactions (dopaminergic, antipsychotics), and sudden functional decline.
  #3: Research daily life adjustments and support strategies for Parkinson’s patients after Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): immediate post-op restrictions, long-term device care/charging, programming follow-ups, recognizing stimulation side effects and hardware complications, MRI/security/electromagnetic safety, medication changes post-DBS, and home/rehab strategies to improve comfort and quality of life.
  #4: Research practical family support strategies across Parkinson’s stages (with or without DBS): fall-prevention home modifications; freezing-of-gait cueing; safe transfers; swallowing/meal adaptations and aspiration prevention; constipation and urinary dysfunction routines; skin/pressure injury prevention; sleep issues incl. REM behavior disorder; cognitive/psychological support; and triggers for considering home nursing, respite, palliative care or hospice.
  #5: Research Parkinson’s medication- and treatment-related warning signs by stage: wearing-off/on–off fluctuations, dyskinesias, dopamine agonist adverse effects (sleep attacks, impulse-control disorders, hallucinations), anticholinergic burden, polypharmacy interactions. Include caregiver monitoring tools like medication/symptom diaries, fall logs, constipation logs, orthostatic BP checks, weight tracking, and how diet/protein timing, dehydration, and sleep affect symptom volatility.
  #6: Research caregiver ‘commonly missed’ warning signs in Parkinson’s disease (especially non-motor): silent aspiration, dehydration, malnutrition/weight loss, depression/suicidality, apathy, pain, constipation/ileus, urinary retention/UTI delirium, orthostatic hypotension, medication mis-timing in hospital, and caregiver burnout; prioritize guidance from reputable foundations/clinical resources.

============================================================

ANSWER:
Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression is **highly variable**—not everyone develops the same symptoms, and the *speed* of change differs widely [[1]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/what-is-parkinsons/stages). What families can do well is (a) recognize what tends to show up as PD advances, (b) learn which changes are **expected-but-actionable** vs **true red flags**, and (c) put daily supports in place (especially after DBS) that reduce preventable complications.

---

## 1) How “stages” map to real-life changes (and why this matters for warning signs)

### The two most common clinical ways to describe progression
- **Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y)**: a practical staging focused mainly on **motor disability, balance, and independence**:
  - **1**: unilateral symptoms  
  - **2**: bilateral symptoms, **no balance impairment**  
  - **3**: **postural instability** begins (falls become more likely) but person remains physically independent  
  - **4**: severe disability; may still stand/walk unassisted but needs major help  
  - **5**: wheelchair-bound/bedridden without help [[1]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/what-is-parkinsons/stages), [[3]](https://www.parkinsons.va.gov/resources/HY.asp)
- **MDS-UPDRS**: a detailed score across **non-motor daily living + motor daily living + exam + complications (fluctuations/dyskinesias)**; often used to track change and guide treatment adjustments [[7]](https://www.movementdisorders.org/MDS-Files1/Resources/PDFs/MDS-UPDRS.pdf). Severity cutoffs (mild/moderate/severe) have been proposed but are not universally “the” definition of advanced PD [[8]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25466406/), [[10]](https://davisphinneyfoundation.org/blog/advanced-parkinsons/).

### “Advanced PD” (useful for family decisions)
A consensus (Delphi) definition emphasizes **milestones that change risk and care needs**, not just years since diagnosis. “Definitive” advanced-PD indicators included:
- **Disability requiring help for ADLs**
- **Motor fluctuations limiting basic ADLs** (e.g., off time >25% with limitation)
- **Severe dysphagia**
- **Recurrent falls**
- **Dementia** [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5292396/)

Those are particularly important because they correlate with **aspiration, injuries, hospitalization, and caregiver burden**.

---

## 2) Stage-by-stage: likely symptoms *and* the warning signs families should watch for

Below, “warning signs” are the things that should trigger *more support, treatment adjustment, or urgent evaluation*, even if they’re common later in PD.

### A) Prodromal / very early PD (often before diagnosis)
**What may appear** (often years before motor symptoms):
- Loss of smell, constipation, depression, REM sleep behavior disorder (acting out dreams), fatigue [[1]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/what-is-parkinsons/stages), [[5]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/1201/p679.html), [[66]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms).

**Family warning signs to act on early**
- **REM sleep behavior disorder** with injury risk (patient or bed partner getting hit/kicked; falling out of bed) should prompt medical discussion because it’s treatable and affects safety [[51]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/sleep-disorders), [[66]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms).
- **Depression** or persistent anxiety—don’t wait; it’s common, treatable, and affects outcomes [[66]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms), [[72]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/emotional-mental-health/depression-mood/suicide).

---

### B) H&Y 1–2 (early PD): unilateral → bilateral, still independent
**Typical pattern**
- Tremor/rigidity/bradykinesia; mild gait/posture changes; tasks take longer; still living independently [[1]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/what-is-parkinsons/stages).

**Warning signs families often miss**
1. **Medication side effects** after dose changes: dizziness/lightheadedness, excessive sleepiness, confusion, hallucinations, dyskinesia—these are not “just progression” and often respond to medication adjustment [[13]](https://www.uhd.nhs.uk/uploads/services/docs/parkinsons/147-23_planning-for-change-parkinson-symptoms.pdf), [[53]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9945884/).  
2. **Orthostatic hypotension (OH)**: lightheadedness on standing, “legs buckling,” blurred vision, cognitive slowing—can cause falls and sometimes fainting [[20]](https://www.movementdisorders.org/MDS/Resources/Patient-Education/Orthostatic-Hypotension-in-Parkinsons-Disease.htm), [[69]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/blood-pressure).  
3. **Impulse control disorders (ICDs)** if dopamine agonists are used: new gambling/shopping/hypersexuality/binge eating, secretive behavior. Occurs in ~1 in 6 people taking dopamine agonists and is often hidden unless caregivers monitor [[60]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/impulse-control).  
4. **Sleep attacks/daytime sleepiness** (especially with dopamine agonists): dozing in unusual situations or sudden sleep while driving is a major safety issue [[51]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/sleep-disorders), [[58]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10371546/), [[59]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11798367/).

**When to seek advice (early PD)**
- New fainting/syncope or repeated near-falls with standing → prompt clinician contact and orthostatic BP checks [[21]](https://www.parkinson.org/blog/research/passing-out), [[69]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/blood-pressure).
- Any new ICD behaviors, hallucinations, or confusion after medication changes → contact treating team promptly (do not stop meds abruptly) [[13]](https://www.uhd.nhs.uk/uploads/services/docs/parkinsons/147-23_planning-for-change-parkinson-symptoms.pdf), [[60]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/impulse-control).

---

### C) H&Y 3 (mid-stage): balance impairment becomes the hallmark
**Typical pattern**
- Postural instability; turning is harder; falls become more common; increasing functional restriction but may remain physically independent [[1]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/what-is-parkinsons/stages), [[3]](https://www.parkinsons.va.gov/resources/HY.asp).

**Warning signs**
1. **Falls—especially “recurrent falls”**: a major inflection point in risk and often a marker of more advanced disease biology and/or suboptimal therapy [[1]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/what-is-parkinsons/stages), [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5292396/).  
2. **Freezing of gait (FOG)**: feet “glued,” especially at turns/doorways or when rushed; strongly linked to falls [[43]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/what-is-parkinsons/symptoms/freezing-of-gait/).  
3. **Swallowing changes** starting subtly: longer meals, coughing with meals/pills, gurgly voice, drooling. Dysphagia can become critical and aspiration can be *silent* [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing), [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva), [[67]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6995701/).  
4. **Motor fluctuations** (“wearing off,” unpredictable off periods) and emerging dyskinesias—often appear years into treatment and can drive injury risk and panic/anxiety [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7029239/), [[52]](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/documents/motor-fluctuations.pdf).  
5. **Autonomic issues**: OH, urinary urgency/frequency, constipation worsening—these can destabilize cognition, sleep, and medication response [[20]](https://www.movementdisorders.org/MDS/Resources/Patient-Education/Orthostatic-Hypotension-in-Parkinsons-Disease.htm), [[48]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/constipation), [[49]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/urinary-problems).

**Family actions that matter most at this stage**
- Begin/refresh **PT/OT** focused on balance, turning, cueing strategies for freezing, and fall prevention [[39]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/treatment/physical-occupational-speech-therapies), [[42]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10585979/).
- Ask early for **speech-language pathology** swallow evaluation when the first signs appear—don’t wait for choking [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing), [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva).

---

### D) H&Y 4–5 (advanced PD): dependence, high complication risk
**Typical pattern**
- Needs substantial help for ADLs; may need walker/wheelchair; cannot live alone; later may be wheelchair/bed-bound with round-the-clock care needs [[1]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/what-is-parkinsons/stages), [[3]](https://www.parkinsons.va.gov/resources/HY.asp), [[10]](https://davisphinneyfoundation.org/blog/advanced-parkinsons/).

**High-importance warning signs (often missed until a crisis)**
1. **Dysphagia / aspiration risk**
   - Silent aspiration is common; aspiration pneumonia is a leading cause of death in PD [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing), [[67]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6995701/).
   - Red flags: repeated coughing during meals, wet/gurgly voice after swallowing, weight loss, dehydration, recurrent “chest infections” [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing), [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva), [[67]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6995701/).
2. **Sudden confusion / hallucinations**
   - May reflect infection (UTI/chest infection), dehydration, medication toxicity, or delirium—often treatable triggers [[13]](https://www.uhd.nhs.uk/uploads/services/docs/parkinsons/147-23_planning-for-change-parkinson-symptoms.pdf), [[22]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/drugs/side-effects/hallucinations-delusions), [[78]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/incontinence).
   - Hallucinations with **loss of insight** and delusions are more severe markers [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7029239/), [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5292396/).
3. **Severe constipation → impaction/obstruction**
   - Can become an urgent medical condition; fecal “overflow” leakage can paradoxically signal impaction; bowel obstruction is a dangerous emergency in advanced PD [[48]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/constipation), [[75]](https://www.parkinson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Constipation-and-Parkinsons-Fact-Sheet_2025.pdf), [[77]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/bowel-and-bladder-management-in-advanced-parkinsons-disease/).
4. **Urinary retention and UTIs**
   - Older adults may show infection primarily as **confusion/hallucinations**; untreated UTIs can require hospitalization [[78]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/incontinence).
5. **Pressure injury risk** with reduced mobility, moisture/incontinence, poor nutrition [[50]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2023/0800/pressure-injuries.html).
6. **Caregiver burnout** → directly affects patient safety, medication accuracy, and falls prevention [[82]](https://www.parkinson.org/resources-support/carepartners/caring-for-self).

## 3) A practical “triage” guide: which signs mean *emergency now* vs *urgent same-day* vs *routine*

PD patients can deteriorate from **intercurrent illness, medication problems, autonomic failure, aspiration, or neuropsychiatric crises**. A key rule from a PD care planning guide: if a major change happens **within days to a couple of weeks**, it’s often **not simply PD progression** (unless a medication change occurred)—look for a trigger and treat it [[13]](https://www.uhd.nhs.uk/uploads/services/docs/parkinsons/147-23_planning-for-change-parkinson-symptoms.pdf).

### A) **Call emergency services / go to ER now**
1. **Choking / cannot breathe** (airway emergency) [[14]](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/sites/default/files/DDA/dda/documents/Aspiration.pdf), [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva).  
2. **Aspiration pneumonia with serious symptoms**: chest pain, high fever, difficulty breathing/shortness of breath—pneumonia can worsen quickly [[15]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21954-aspiration-pneumonia), [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva).  
3. **Suspected parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome (PHS)** / NMS-like crisis:
   - **High fever + severe rigidity/bradykinesia + confusion/altered mental state + autonomic instability (sweating, tachycardia)**, often after **sudden levodopa withdrawal** or **DBS malfunction**; can be fatal [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616322/), [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7029239/).  
4. **Severe psychosis/agitation with danger** (violence risk, unsafe behavior) [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7029239/).  
5. **Syncope with injury**, repeated fainting, or very severe OH symptoms (especially if new) → emergency evaluation is often appropriate; syncope is a common reason PD patients end up in ER [[21]](https://www.parkinson.org/blog/research/passing-out).  
6. **Suicidal intent/plan or imminent risk** → emergency response; call emergency services/988/911 (jurisdiction-dependent) [[72]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/emotional-mental-health/depression-mood/suicide).  
7. **Severe constipation with obstruction warning signs** (examples: severe abdominal pain/distension, inability to pass stool/gas, fecal “overflow” leakage with worsening pain) → urgent emergency evaluation; bowel obstruction can require surgery [[75]](https://www.parkinson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Constipation-and-Parkinsons-Fact-Sheet_2025.pdf), [[77]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/bowel-and-bladder-management-in-advanced-parkinsons-disease/).

### B) **Same-day / urgent contact with PD clinician or primary care**
1. **Sudden worsening over days** of walking, cognition, swallowing, or alertness—even if no fever—evaluate for infection, dehydration, medication toxicity, missed doses [[13]](https://www.uhd.nhs.uk/uploads/services/docs/parkinsons/147-23_planning-for-change-parkinson-symptoms.pdf), [[17]](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/documents/ALL-hospital-safety-guide-forms.pdf).  
2. **New hallucinations/delusions**, or worsening hallucinations—especially in older adults or if insight is reduced [[22]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/drugs/side-effects/hallucinations-delusions), [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7029239/).  
3. **Frequent falls**, new inability to turn/transfer safely, or freezing that is suddenly worse [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5292396/), [[43]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/what-is-parkinsons/symptoms/freezing-of-gait/).  
4. **New swallowing difficulty** (coughing with meals/pills, wet voice, weight loss, avoiding liquids) → request SLP swallow evaluation urgently; aspiration may be silent [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing), [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva).  
5. **Orthostatic symptoms** causing near-falls, recurrent dizziness, or any passing out → prompt evaluation and medication review [[21]](https://www.parkinson.org/blog/research/passing-out), [[69]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/blood-pressure).  
6. **Possible UTI** (especially if confusion/hallucinations are new), urinary retention symptoms, fever or flank pain [[78]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/incontinence), [[79]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/qs-urinary-dysfunction-parkinsons-disease/).  
7. **Medication-related behavioral emergencies** (ICDs, mania, severe insomnia, new compulsions) especially after dopamine agonist changes [[60]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/impulse-control), [[26]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24958-dopamine-agonists), [[27]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551686/).  
8. **Hospitalization advocacy triggers**: if in hospital/ED, and PD meds are delayed/omitted or contraindicated dopamine-blockers are ordered (e.g., haloperidol, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) → intervene immediately and request PD-safe alternatives [[17]](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/documents/ALL-hospital-safety-guide-forms.pdf), [[64]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons-disease/treatment-medication/meds-to-avoid/), [[68]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5737245/), [[80]](https://www.parkinson.org/resources-support/hospital-safety-guide).

### C) **Routine follow-up (but track and report)**
- Gradual wearing-off, mild dyskinesia, slowly worsening constipation, sleep fragmentation, mild urinary urgency—these still deserve treatment optimization, but usually do not require emergency action unless escalating [[13]](https://www.uhd.nhs.uk/uploads/services/docs/parkinsons/147-23_planning-for-change-parkinson-symptoms.pdf), [[52]](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/documents/motor-fluctuations.pdf), [[48]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/constipation), [[51]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/sleep-disorders).

---

## 4) Medication- and treatment-related warning signs families should explicitly monitor

### A) Wearing-off / “on–off” fluctuations
- “On” = good mobility; “Off” = slow/stiff, may freeze, may have anxiety/pain/sweating/tachycardia during severe off episodes [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7029239/), [[52]](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/documents/motor-fluctuations.pdf).  
- Worsening or unpredictable “off” time increases fall risk and distress and often needs regimen changes [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7029239/), [[52]](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/documents/motor-fluctuations.pdf).

**Family tool**
- Use a structured **motor diary** (30-minute intervals; ON / OFF / ON with troublesome dyskinesia / asleep). This is explicitly used to fine-tune meds and DBS programming [[65]](https://www.parkinsons.va.gov/resources/motordiary.pdf).

### B) Dyskinesias and dystonia
- Dyskinesias can be peak-dose, diphasic, or “off-period” dystonia; management differs by type [[57]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5586110/).  
- Severe dyskinesias can interfere with sitting/walking and can be exhausting; some reports note possible autonomic symptoms during dyskinesia periods [[57]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5586110/).

**Family tool**
- Record *timing* relative to doses (before dose, 30–60 min after, near next dose) + severity + fall risk [[57]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5586110/), [[65]](https://www.parkinsons.va.gov/resources/motordiary.pdf).

### C) Dopamine agonist “big 3” risks (especially important for families)
1. **Impulse-control disorders**: gambling, spending, hypersexuality, binge eating; often hidden; require proactive caregiver monitoring with patient consent [[60]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/impulse-control), [[61]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11098885/).  
2. **Sleep attacks / dangerous somnolence**: particularly driving risk [[51]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/sleep-disorders), [[58]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10371546/), [[59]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11798367/).  
3. **Hallucinations, confusion, orthostatic hypotension**: can precipitate falls and delirium [[25]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4797835/), [[26]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24958-dopamine-agonists), [[53]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9945884/).

### D) Anticholinergic burden (often overlooked)
Anticholinergics can worsen **confusion, hallucinations, constipation, urinary retention, drowsiness, and falls**, and are generally discouraged in older adults and people with cognitive impairment; if deprescribed, tapering is recommended (not abrupt stopping) [[62]](https://www.nswtag.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1.5-Deprescribing-Guide-for-Anticholinergic-drugs-for-Parkinsonism.pdf).

### E) Food/absorption issues that create “mysterious” variability
- In some (often more advanced) patients, **dietary protein competes with levodopa transport** (protein effect) and reduces medication effectiveness; consider dietitian-guided strategies if suspected [[54]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/levodopa-dosing-and-food-intake/).  
- **Constipation and slowed gastric emptying** can delay levodopa absorption and worsen fluctuations [[48]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/constipation), [[53]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9945884/).  
- **Iron supplements** can reduce levodopa absorption; spacing by ~2 hours is commonly advised [[55]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/magazine/spotlight/can-other-drugs-affect-my-parkinsons-medication), [[54]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/levodopa-dosing-and-food-intake/).

**Family tool**
- If response is inconsistent: keep a **food + medication + symptom diary** for several days and review with neurology/dietitian [[54]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/levodopa-dosing-and-food-intake/).

### F) Dangerous interaction patterns to prevent (especially in emergency care)
- Drugs that block dopamine receptors can dramatically worsen PD: many **antipsychotics and anti-nausea drugs** (e.g., haloperidol; metoclopramide; prochlorperazine; promethazine) should be avoided; PD-safe options exist (e.g., ondansetron for nausea; and specific antipsychotic approaches for PD psychosis) [[17]](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/documents/ALL-hospital-safety-guide-forms.pdf), [[64]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons-disease/treatment-medication/meds-to-avoid/), [[55]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/magazine/spotlight/can-other-drugs-affect-my-parkinsons-medication).  
- If on MAO-B inhibitors, certain opioids/cough meds/decongestants raise risk of serious interactions; review all new OTC meds with clinician/pharmacist [[64]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons-disease/treatment-medication/meds-to-avoid/), [[55]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/magazine/spotlight/can-other-drugs-affect-my-parkinsons-medication).  
- Serotonin syndrome with MAO-B inhibitor + SSRI appears **rare but reported**; know the early cluster (agitation, tremor, clonus, sweating, fever) especially after dose changes/additions [[63]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6019085/).

---

## 5) Commonly missed non-motor “warning signs” (and why they matter)

### 1) Silent aspiration and subtle dysphagia
- Aspiration can occur **without coughing**; dysphagia worsens with disease; weight loss, drooling, and dementia predict dysphagia risk [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing), [[67]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6995701/).  
- Aspiration pneumonia symptoms: chest pain, painful/difficult breathing, cough with phlegm/blood, fever—seek care promptly [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva), [[15]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21954-aspiration-pneumonia).

### 2) Dehydration as a “hidden driver” of falls, delirium, constipation, OH
- Dehydration worsens low BP and can cause weakness/foggy thinking and falls [[69]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/blood-pressure).  
- Many patients restrict fluids due to urinary urgency, worsening constipation and OH [[48]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/constipation), [[69]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/blood-pressure).

### 3) Infection presenting as confusion/hallucinations
- UTIs and chest infections can present mainly as **sudden confusion/hallucinations** in older adults and may be mistaken for “PD getting worse” [[78]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/incontinence), [[22]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/drugs/side-effects/hallucinations-delusions), [[13]](https://www.uhd.nhs.uk/uploads/services/docs/parkinsons/147-23_planning-for-change-parkinson-symptoms.pdf).

### 4) Depression, hopelessness, and suicidality
- Up to ~30% report suicidal thoughts when asked; warning signs include hopelessness, withdrawal, dramatic mood changes, “goodbye” behavior, sudden calm after severe depression—treat as urgent [[72]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/emotional-mental-health/depression-mood/suicide).  
- Depression is common and treatable but often missed [[66]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms), [[72]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/emotional-mental-health/depression-mood/suicide).

### 5) Apathy (not the same as depression)
- Very common; often first noticed by caregivers; can directly reduce medication adherence and self-care [[73]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/apathy).

### 6) Severe constipation complications
- “Overflow” watery leakage can mean impaction; bowel obstruction/volvulus risk requires immediate medical attention [[75]](https://www.parkinson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Constipation-and-Parkinsons-Fact-Sheet_2025.pdf), [[77]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/bowel-and-bladder-management-in-advanced-parkinsons-disease/), [[76]](https://parkinson.bc.ca/resources-support/resource-centre/help-sheet-bowel-management-program-for-constipation).

### 7) Caregiver burnout
- Burnout is predictable and measurable; it increases patient risk (med errors, falls, missed early infection signs). Respite and help should be early interventions, not last resorts [[82]](https://www.parkinson.org/resources-support/carepartners/caring-for-self).

---

## 6) What families can do day-to-day (all stages): concrete support strategies that improve comfort and safety

### A) Fall prevention & home setup (high yield)
A PD home safety checklist emphasizes: remove clutter/rugs, improve lighting, secure furniture with armrests, wide walking paths, cords out of the way, bathroom grab bars, shower bench, elevated toilet seat, stair handrails, high-contrast tape on step edges, and avoid ladders/step stools [[41]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/management/activities-daily-living/home-safety). Falls are common in PD and often occur during everyday mobility tasks at home; repeat falls are common and fear of falling can lead to deconditioning [[42]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10585979/).

**Practical family routines**
- “Clear path” rule: no loose rugs, no cords, no narrow obstacle courses [[41]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/management/activities-daily-living/home-safety).  
- Bathroom is highest risk—prioritize it first (grab bars, non-slip, good lighting, raised toilet) [[41]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/management/activities-daily-living/home-safety).  
- Ask for an OT **home safety evaluation** for individualized recommendations [[41]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/management/activities-daily-living/home-safety).

### B) Freezing of gait: cueing that families can coach
Cueing can “break” a freeze. Options include: shift weight side-to-side, march in place, step sideways then forward, count “1-2-3-go,” use a metronome beat, step over an imagined line/object, or use a laser line cue if available [[43]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/what-is-parkinsons/symptoms/freezing-of-gait/). If a walker is needed, specialized walkers (e.g., reverse-braking designs) may reduce falls during freezes; PT can help choose and train use [[43]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/what-is-parkinsons/symptoms/freezing-of-gait/).

### C) Safe transfers and mobility assistance
Using a gait belt and proper mechanics can prevent caregiver injury and patient falls; allow the person to stand briefly before walking to reduce dizziness; if you cannot safely assist, ease to floor and get help [[45]](https://www.agrace.org/find-care/caregiver-education/mobility-and-safe-transfers/). (Ideally get PT/OT instruction specific to the patient.)

### D) Swallowing/meal strategies (until formal SLP guidance)
Key principles:
- Eat **upright**, minimize distractions, small bites/sips, slow pace, and stay upright after meals (foundation caregiver guidance emphasizes upright feeding and remaining upright after eating) [[70]](https://www.parkinson.org/resources-support/carepartners/advanced/daily-living).  
- Early SLP involvement is recommended; diet/texture modifications and posture strategies are commonly used [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing), [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva), [[47]](https://hign.org/consultgeri/try-this-series/preventing-aspiration-older-adults-dysphagia).  
- Oral hygiene reduces aspiration pneumonia risk (mouth bacteria can be aspirated) [[47]](https://hign.org/consultgeri/try-this-series/preventing-aspiration-older-adults-dysphagia).

### E) Constipation plan (prevention beats crisis)
A PD constipation “bowel program” stresses fluids, fiber/food choices, regular timing after meals, honoring the urge, positioning, and exercise; keep a constipation diary because trial-and-error is common [[48]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/constipation). Severe constipation can become impaction/obstruction—know red flags (above) [[75]](https://www.parkinson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Constipation-and-Parkinsons-Fact-Sheet_2025.pdf), [[77]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/bowel-and-bladder-management-in-advanced-parkinsons-disease/).

### F) Urinary routines
Urinary dysfunction often appears later; urgency/frequency are common; emptying problems (retention) also occur and can drive UTIs [[49]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/urinary-problems), [[78]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/incontinence), [[79]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/qs-urinary-dysfunction-parkinsons-disease/). Timed voiding and “double voiding” can help retention; urology and pelvic floor PT may help [[79]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/qs-urinary-dysfunction-parkinsons-disease/), [[78]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/incontinence).

### G) Sleep support (including caregivers)
Sleep problems affect >75% of PD patients and disrupt caregiver sleep too [[51]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/sleep-disorders). Sleep hygiene strategies include regular schedule, morning light/exercise, limiting naps late in day, cool/dark room, and adapting bedding to make turning easier (satin sheets/pajamas) [[51]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/sleep-disorders). Dopamine agonists can cause daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks—do not allow driving if sleepy [[51]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/sleep-disorders).

### H) Rehab therapies (PT/OT/SLP) as ongoing maintenance, not a one-time event
Rehab helps maintain independence and safety and should be revisited periodically, not only after a crisis [[39]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/treatment/physical-occupational-speech-therapies). Increasing physical activity (e.g., ≥2.5 hours/week) is associated with slower decline in quality of life in large observational project data [[39]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/treatment/physical-occupational-speech-therapies).

---

## 7) DBS patients: daily-life adjustments and support strategies (comfort + safety)

DBS can significantly improve motor symptoms and medication complications for selected patients, but it **does not stop PD progression** [[30]](https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/l/patients/treatments-therapies/deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease/important-safety-information.html), [[31]](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pdmdc/assets/user-content/deep-brain-stimulation-guide-parkinsons.pdf). Families help most by (1) supporting safe recovery, (2) building reliable device routines, and (3) watching for stimulation side effects or hardware problems early.

### A) Right after DBS surgery: practical home support
**Wound care & infection monitoring**
- Follow your surgical program’s incision instructions exactly; typical guidance includes keeping dressings on briefly, keeping incisions dry for a period, gentle washing later, and monitoring for drainage/redness/swelling/fever [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf), [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).  
- Call the surgical team for fever, incision drainage, ongoing bleeding, or increasing redness/swelling (program-specific thresholds exist) [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf).  
- Wash pillowcases/towels more frequently during early healing per some program guidance [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).

**Activity restrictions (vary by center—confirm locally)**
- Common advice: avoid strenuous activity early; avoid heavy lifting (often framed as >20 lbs) for a period ranging from ~2 weeks to 4–6 weeks depending on program and patient [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf), [[32]](https://davisphinneyfoundation.org/blog/dbs-recovery/).  
- Plan for fatigue: some patients feel very tired for weeks after surgery [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).

**Medication caution: the “honeymoon effect”**
- Some people temporarily feel better after lead placement even while stimulation is off; this is typically temporary. Do **not** change PD meds on your own during this period unless instructed [[32]](https://davisphinneyfoundation.org/blog/dbs-recovery/), [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).  
- After surgery, patients usually restart PD meds as instructed; blood-thinner restart needs explicit guidance [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf).

**Early programming schedule**
- Activation/programming timing varies by center (often ~1 month or ~6–8 weeks). Expect several visits and adjustments, especially in the first 6 months [[31]](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pdmdc/assets/user-content/deep-brain-stimulation-guide-parkinsons.pdf), [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf), [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).

---

### B) Long-term DBS daily routines that improve comfort and prevent crises

#### 1) Make device management “boring and automatic”
- Carry DBS ID card and controller/programmer routinely; when traveling, keep the programmer with you because security magnets can switch the device off [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).  
- For rechargeable systems:
  - **Check battery daily** and build a charging routine that fits your settings and schedule [[36]](https://www.medtronic.com/uk-en/patients/treatments-therapies/deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease/living-with-dbs/how-to-use-your-patient-recharger.html).  
  - Manufacturer guidance commonly allows either short frequent charges or longer periodic charges; consistency prevents therapy interruption [[36]](https://www.medtronic.com/uk-en/patients/treatments-therapies/deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease/living-with-dbs/how-to-use-your-patient-recharger.html), [[37]](https://www.bostonscientific.com/content/dam/elabeling/nm/92441280-02_Rev_A_DBS_Charging_Handbook_Belt_PI_IFU_EN_s.pdf).  
  - **Do not charge while sleeping** (burn risk) and stop charging if pain/discomfort occurs [[37]](https://www.bostonscientific.com/content/dam/elabeling/nm/92441280-02_Rev_A_DBS_Charging_Handbook_Belt_PI_IFU_EN_s.pdf).  
  - Keep charging equipment dry and safely stored away from damage [[37]](https://www.bostonscientific.com/content/dam/elabeling/nm/92441280-02_Rev_A_DBS_Charging_Handbook_Belt_PI_IFU_EN_s.pdf).

#### 2) Recognize stimulation side effects early (often fixable with reprogramming)
Stimulation can cause reversible issues such as tingling, speech changes, dizziness, balance problems/falls, gait worsening, involuntary movements, cognitive or mood/behavior changes, and more; many can improve by parameter adjustment or turning stimulation off temporarily per clinician guidance [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf), [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/). Medtronic safety information also highlights risk of new/worsening psychiatric symptoms including depression and suicidality in some patients—take mood changes seriously and report promptly [[30]](https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/l/patients/treatments-therapies/deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease/important-safety-information.html).

**Family strategy**
- After each programming change, monitor and write down:
  - speech (volume/clarity), swallowing changes, balance/near-falls, mood/impulsivity, confusion, sleep, and dyskinesia pattern [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf), [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).  
- Bring logs to programming; use a motor diary if fluctuations/dyskinesia are complex [[65]](https://www.parkinsons.va.gov/resources/motordiary.pdf).

#### 3) Watch for hardware complications (don’t assume “PD progression”)
Contact clinicians urgently for:
- Redness/tenderness/oozing over wounds or device tract, fever/feeling unwell without clear cause (possible infection) [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).  
- Skin erosion over wires/IPG (rare but serious) [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).  
- Sudden loss of benefit on one/both sides (possible lead break, device shutoff, low battery) [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).  
- Recurrent unexplained switch-offs (report) [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).

#### 4) Electromagnetic & procedure safety (critical)
- **Diathermy is dangerous** and can cause severe brain injury; DBS is contraindicated with certain diathermy exposures and must be communicated to all providers [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf), [[30]](https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/l/patients/treatments-therapies/deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease/important-safety-information.html), [[38]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8081063/).  
- **MRI is not “routine”** in DBS: only under device-specific MRI-conditional protocols at DBS-capable centers; improper MRI can heat leads and cause injury [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf), [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/), [[38]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8081063/), [[30]](https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/l/patients/treatments-therapies/deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease/important-safety-information.html).  
- Security/theft detectors can briefly increase stimulation or switch device on/off; walk through calmly, don’t linger, and check device if symptoms change [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf), [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).  
- Avoid strong magnets and high-power industrial electromagnetic sources; if you feel unusual stimulation, move away and troubleshoot with programmer [[33]](https://healthonline.washington.edu/sites/default/files/record_pdfs/Deep-Brain-Stimulation-Parkinsons.pdf), [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).

#### 5) Medication adjustments after DBS: go slow and monitor mood
Early/over-aggressive medication reduction after STN-DBS has been associated with worse short-term neuropsychiatric outcomes in some studies; careful clinician-guided adjustment with monitoring for depression/anxiety/impulsivity is important [[35]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2023.1270746/full). Many programs explicitly caution not to change meds independently during early recovery and programming [[32]](https://davisphinneyfoundation.org/blog/dbs-recovery/), [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/).

---

### C) Rehab and lifestyle supports specifically after DBS
- PT is still valuable post-DBS, especially for gait, balance, posture, freezing, and fall risk—DBS may help some motor symptoms while axial/gait symptoms can persist or vary [[40]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11469472/).  
- A Delphi expert panel supported conventional PT as part of multidisciplinary DBS care, even though evidence is still developing [[40]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11469472/).  
- Continue OT/SLP supports because PD non-motor issues and swallowing/speech changes can progress despite DBS [[39]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/treatment/physical-occupational-speech-therapies), [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing).

**Practical “comfort upgrades” after DBS**
- Schedule demanding tasks during best symptom windows (often after meds and when DBS settings feel optimal) [[39]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/treatment/physical-occupational-speech-therapies).  
- If charging causes discomfort, adjust alignment/ventilation and belt tightness; stop if pain occurs [[37]](https://www.bostonscientific.com/content/dam/elabeling/nm/92441280-02_Rev_A_DBS_Charging_Handbook_Belt_PI_IFU_EN_s.pdf).  
- Make travel plans include: DBS card, programmer, charging equipment, and time buffers for fatigue [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/), [[31]](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pdmdc/assets/user-content/deep-brain-stimulation-guide-parkinsons.pdf).

---

## 8) When families should consider stepping up care (home help, respite, palliative)
Consider higher-level support when any of the following appear repeatedly:
- Recurrent falls, unsafe transfers, nighttime wandering/confusion, caregiver unable to safely assist [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5292396/), [[82]](https://www.parkinson.org/resources-support/carepartners/caring-for-self).  
- Dysphagia with weight loss/dehydration or recurrent aspiration events [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing), [[67]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6995701/).  
- Dementia/psychosis with loss of insight that compromises safety [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5292396/), [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7029239/).  
- Caregiver strain progressing toward burnout—respite and home health aides are recommended as **early interventions** [[82]](https://www.parkinson.org/resources-support/carepartners/caring-for-self).

---

## 9) Quick “family checklist” (put this on your refrigerator)

### Seek urgent medical advice if you notice:
- Sudden decline over days (walking, thinking, swallowing) [[13]](https://www.uhd.nhs.uk/uploads/services/docs/parkinsons/147-23_planning-for-change-parkinson-symptoms.pdf)  
- New hallucinations/delusions or worsening psychosis [[22]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/drugs/side-effects/hallucinations-delusions)  
- Recurrent falls or sudden worsening freezing [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5292396/), [[43]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/what-is-parkinsons/symptoms/freezing-of-gait/)  
- Coughing with meals/pills, wet voice, weight loss, avoiding liquids [[24]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/speech-swallowing), [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva)  
- Passing out or severe dizziness on standing [[21]](https://www.parkinson.org/blog/research/passing-out), [[69]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/blood-pressure)  
- Constipation >3 days with pain/distension, or watery leakage suggesting impaction [[48]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/constipation), [[75]](https://www.parkinson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Constipation-and-Parkinsons-Fact-Sheet_2025.pdf)  
- UTI signs or sudden confusion/hallucinations in older adult [[78]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/incontinence)

### Emergency now if:
- Choking/can’t breathe [[14]](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/sites/default/files/DDA/dda/documents/Aspiration.pdf), [[46]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information/symptoms/non-motor/eating-swallowing-managing-saliva)  
- Chest pain + fever + breathing difficulty (possible pneumonia) [[15]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21954-aspiration-pneumonia)  
- Fever + severe rigidity/bradykinesia + confusion (possible PHS/NMS-like crisis—especially after missed levodopa or DBS malfunction) [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616322/), [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7029239/)  
- Suicidal plan/intent [[72]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/emotional-mental-health/depression-mood/suicide)

### For DBS patients:
- Redness/oozing/fever, skin breakdown over device [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/)  
- Sudden loss of benefit/device shutoff you can’t correct with programmer [[34]](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/information-for-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-patients-leaving-hospital/)

---

## 10) Most important “meta-skill” for families: measure patterns, not just events
Keeping simple logs often prevents crises:
- **Motor diary** for ON/OFF/dyskinesia (especially with DBS programming) [[65]](https://www.parkinsons.va.gov/resources/motordiary.pdf)  
- **Bowel log** (frequency, stool form; constipation worsens meds response and delirium risk) [[48]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/constipation), [[53]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9945884/)  
- **Food/med timing log** if response is inconsistent (protein effect, iron, gastroparesis/constipation) [[54]](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/levodopa-dosing-and-food-intake/), [[55]](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/magazine/spotlight/can-other-drugs-affect-my-parkinsons-medication), [[48]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/constipation)  
- **Orthostatic BP checks** (lying, then standing at 1 and 3 minutes) when dizziness/falls occur [[69]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/blood-pressure)  
- **Behavior/sleep log** for ICDs, hallucinations, sleep attacks, depression/apathy [[60]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/impulse-control), [[51]](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/sleep-disorders), [[72]](https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/emotional-mental-health/depression-mood/suicide), [[73]](https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/apathy)

If you want, tell me:
1) the patient’s approximate H&Y stage (or a plain-language description of independence/falls/swallowing/cognition),  
2) whether they have DBS (and which target, if known—STN vs GPi), and  
3) the top 3 problems you’re seeing at home,  
and I can convert the above into a **personalized “action plan”** (what to monitor weekly, what to change at home, and what to ask neurology at the next visit).
