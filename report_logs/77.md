ANSWER:
### 1) What “need for closure” is, and why it should matter for misinformation

**Need for cognitive closure (NFC/NCC/NFCC)** is an epistemic motivation: a desire for definite answers and an aversion to uncertainty/ambiguity. It can be **trait-like** (stable individual difference) and also **state-like** (situationally induced, e.g., by time pressure, noise, fatigue) [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637961/), [[4]](http://fitelson.org/current/seizing.pdf). Classic theory argues NFC expresses itself through two broad tendencies:

- **Urgency (“seizing”)**: reaching closure quickly by accepting an available answer.
- **Permanence (“freezing”)**: maintaining closure by resisting reconsideration and minimizing ambiguity re-entry [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637961/), [[2]](https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/socialpsychology/chpt/need-closure), [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full).

In misinformation contexts, this matters because misinformation (including conspiratorial narratives) often **offers quick, coherent, low-ambiguity explanations**—especially attractive when people lack clear answers (crises, fast-moving events, contested science).

A crucial nuance from the broader NFC framework: NFC is **content-free**. It does not inherently push people toward *false* beliefs; it pushes them toward **whatever explanation is most accessible and closure-satisfying in that moment**—which can be accurate *or* inaccurate depending on the information environment [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308).

### 2) Core mechanisms linking NFC to misinformation acceptance

#### A. “Seize and freeze”: early adoption + correction resistance
Under NFC, people tend to accept the first plausible explanation that reduces uncertainty (seizing) and then persist with it (freezing), showing reduced openness to later disconfirming information [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637961/), [[2]](https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/socialpsychology/chpt/need-closure), [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full). This maps naturally onto:
- **initial misinformation uptake** (especially when it provides a simple narrative),
- **resistance to corrections** (because corrections reintroduce uncertainty and require revising a settled view).

#### B. Reduced elaboration and heuristic reliance (often, but not always)
NFC is frequently associated with **simplified processing**, fewer alternative hypotheses considered, and increased reliance on schemas or stereotypes [[2]](https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/socialpsychology/chpt/need-closure), [[4]](http://fitelson.org/current/seizing.pdf). In media contexts, this can manifest as:
- taking headlines/initial frames as sufficient (“good enough” closure),
- relying on peripheral cues (source, group alignment, emotional resonance) rather than deeper evaluation.

But the relationship is not universally monotonic: some work suggests NFC’s effect on heuristic processing depends on whether people can successfully implement closure-consistent strategies (“ability to achieve closure”), producing different patterns across contexts [[8]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24094278/).

#### C. “Crystallization” from early exposure (headline-first vulnerability)
A particularly misinformation-relevant mechanism is that NFC makes people more prone to **lock in** early interpretations. When information arrives in segments (e.g., sensational headline first, later contextual details), high-NFC individuals show stronger “break in the message” effects: they form an early cognitive structure that biases later processing via confirmation bias, often ignoring later qualifying details [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5124571/). Social-media consumption patterns (rapid scrolling, truncated previews, delayed corrections) closely resemble the conditions that can amplify this risk.

#### D. Selective exposure after commitment: supportive search + challenging avoidance
High trait NFC predicts **selective approach to decision-supportive information** and **selective avoidance of decision-challenging information** once a stance is taken [[9]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656612000815). This is important for misinformation ecosystems because it supports:
- self-reinforcing information diets,
- “active ignorance” (not merely passivity),
- greater persistence of misbeliefs due to reduced contact with corrective information.

#### E. Uncertainty–meaning regulation: conspiracies and simple narratives as closure tools
In uncertain/threat contexts, conspiratorial and misinformative explanations can function as “maps of meaning.” Several sources explicitly frame conspiracies as attractive because they provide simple structured accounts of complex events, satisfying epistemic needs for certainty/closure [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full), [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[15]](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/5273/5273.html).

### 3) What the empirical literature shows (2010–Feb 2026): how strong and consistent is the NFC → misinformation link?

The evidence is **mixed** overall. The most defensible summary is:

- NFC has **small, context-dependent associations** with misinformation-related beliefs.
- Effects are most visible when **uncertainty is high** *and* **a closure-providing false narrative is salient/available**.
- In multivariable models with strong predictors (e.g., institutional trust, conspiracy mentality), NFC often **shrinks or becomes non-significant**.

Below is the evidence by outcome type.

---

#### 3.1 Conspiracy endorsement (closest and most-studied cousin of misinformation acceptance)

**Strongest experimental support for conditionality (salience × uncertainty/official account availability):**
- Marchlewska et al. find that NFCC predicts endorsing conspiratorial explanations **for uncertain events when conspiracies are made salient**; importantly, when an **official non-conspiratorial explanation** is available, the relationship can **reverse**, with high-NFCC participants rejecting conspiracies—consistent with freezing on the official account [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308). This is pivotal because it shows NFC does not equal “gullibility”; it equals “closure seeking,” which can attach to whichever explanation is most closure-satisfying and accessible.

**Mixed correlational evidence (including representative designs):**
- A preregistered, multi-wave **representative German survey** (N≈2,883) measured NCC and trust pre-pandemic and COVID-19 conspiracy belief later. It found **higher NCC predicts higher conspiracy endorsement**, but the effect is **small**; trust in political/medical institutions is **much stronger** and there was **no NCC × trust moderation** [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full).
- Earlier work found **no simple relationship** in a small preliminary sample, but showed that **experimentally lowering NFCC reduced the impact of prior conspiracy beliefs on evidence interpretation**, suggesting closure motivation can amplify confirmation-based processing [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3694217/).
- Multivariable COVID-era modeling sometimes finds that NFC-related epistemic motives correlate with conspiratorial thinking but are not among the strongest unique predictors once other factors (e.g., narcissism, analytic thinking) are included [[23]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8212084/).

**Meta-analytic context:** large meta-analyses identify threat, intuitive thinking, and antagonistic traits as major correlates of conspiratorial ideation, with substantial heterogeneity across constructs and conspiracy types [[20]](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000392.pdf). A motives-focused meta-analytic synthesis concludes conspiracy endorsement rises when psychological needs are frustrated, though the excerpted material does not provide NFC-specific pooled estimates [[21]](https://research-portal.uu.nl/files/257106456/Reasons_to_Believe_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analytic_Synthesis_of_the_Motives_Associated_With_Conspiracy_Beliefs.pdf).

**Takeaway:** NFC appears to be a **sometimes-present, usually small** predictor of conspiracy endorsement, highly contingent on **which explanations are salient** and whether trusted/official closure is available [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full), [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308).

---

#### 3.2 Belief in fake news / misinformation items (beyond “conspiracy mentality”)

Here, the record is **particularly mixed**, with several large or multi-country analyses finding weak or null unique effects.

- In a Hungarian election-context study of fake-news belief, NFC was **not consistently associated** with belief in fake news; conspiracy mentality dominated [[17]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8740309/).
- A four-country quota-representative study predicting **susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation** found small bivariate correlations with some need-for-closure facets (e.g., ambiguity/closed-mindedness r≈.17), but **no significant unique effects** of NFC facets in multivariable regression controlling for many covariates and competing predictors; the authors explicitly state no significant associations for NFC facets [[57]](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/13385/13385.html).
- A 2026 study on “when education fails” reports that NFC **less consistently** moderates the protective effect of education against conspiracy beliefs and **susceptibility to misinformation**, such that education’s benefits can disappear at relatively elevated levels of NFC (≈1 SD above mean), though the abstract suggests the effect is weaker/less robust than narcissism [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886925005306). This points to NFC as a *moderator* of “education → susceptibility” rather than a strong direct predictor in all settings.

**Takeaway:** When misinformation is measured as **endorsement of specific false claims** (rather than explanatory conspiracies), NFC often shows **weak or null unique predictive power** once stronger proximal predictors are included (e.g., conspiracy mentality, narcissism, locus of control, trust) [[57]](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/13385/13385.html), [[17]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8740309/), [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886925005306).

---

#### 3.3 Repetition-based belief inflation (illusory truth): NFC often does *not* moderate
A key mechanism in misinformation acceptance is the **illusory truth effect**: repeated statements feel truer. Evidence suggests this effect is **robust** and frequently **not moderated** by NFC.

- A multi-study paper (7 studies; N≈2,196) finds the illusory truth effect robust across individual differences and reports **no evidence of moderation** by need for cognitive closure (tested in Study 1) [[58]](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51ed234ae4b0867e2385d879/t/5d00198d1c604f0001851247/1560287631560/2019+De+keersmaecker+et+al+-+PSPB.pdf).
- Reviews similarly emphasize that repetition effects often do not track the same individual differences that predict discernment, and may even be stronger among people higher in need for cognition in some work (important because “need for cognition” is *not* NFC, but it signals that deliberation does not automatically protect against fluency-based truthiness) [[14]](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-devpsych-010923-093547).

**Takeaway:** NFC is **not a reliable shield** against repetition-based misinformation influence; repetition/fluency can bypass (or at least not depend on) closure motivation [[58]](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51ed234ae4b0867e2385d879/t/5d00198d1c604f0001851247/1560287631560/2019+De+keersmaecker+et+al+-+PSPB.pdf), [[14]](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-devpsych-010923-093547).

---

#### 3.4 Correction, debunking, and “continued influence”: NFC evidence is thinner and mixed
Direct evidence that NFC robustly predicts correction resistance (above and beyond other traits) is limited in the provided sources.

- In an attitude-adjustment experiment after explicit disconfirmation of incorrect information, controlling for need for closure did not change the relationship between cognitive ability and adjustment (NFCC was not the key driver there) [[18]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289617301617).
- Other preregistered correction work highlights **fluid intelligence** (capacity) as predicting stronger correction effects, with need for cognition not significant—suggesting that *ability* can matter more than epistemic motivation for integrating corrections in some paradigms [[19]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11411052/).

Meanwhile, correction best-practice reviews recommend **detailed corrections** and providing **alternative explanations**, and argue myth repetition in corrections has limited backfire risk and that repeating corrections is useful [[53]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X23001574), supported by experiments finding evidence against “familiarity backfire” even when corrections introduce novel misinformation [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7447737/).

**Takeaway:** Theory predicts freezing should reduce updating, but the empirical signal (in these materials) does not yet show NFC as a consistently strong predictor of correction failure compared with cognitive ability and message design [[18]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289617301617), [[19]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11411052/), [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7447737/), [[53]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X23001574).

### 4) Pathways: how NFC shapes misinformation acceptance (and when it doesn’t)

It helps to separate **NFC (closure seeking)** from **need for cognition (enjoyment of thinking)**, because the misinformation literature often emphasizes the latter (and CRT/analytic thinking). NFC can influence misinformation via multiple pathways that interact with these other constructs.

#### A. Analytical thinking / cognitive reflection
Analytical thinking is consistently associated with better truth discernment in headline paradigms [[63]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001002771830163X), [[64]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409329121). NFC can sometimes reduce deep processing (favoring faster closure), but it can also drive *motivated* search for certainty, which may or may not involve careful reasoning depending on what is needed to justify closure in a given social context [[4]](http://fitelson.org/current/seizing.pdf), [[9]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656612000815).

Empirically, in multi-predictor models of conspiratorial beliefs, analytic thinking often emerges as a stronger unique predictor than epistemic motives like closure [[23]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8212084/). This helps explain why NFC’s unique effects often appear small.

#### B. Epistemic vigilance (source and content evaluation)
Epistemic vigilance includes evaluating source credibility and content coherence [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12351225/). NFC can plausibly reduce vigilance when closure is attainable from superficial cues (quick stopping), but can also increase reliance on **epistemic authority as a stopping mechanism**—accepting what a trusted authority says to end uncertainty [[10]](https://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/KruglanskiSaysWho.pdf). This helps explain the “direction can flip” finding: high NFC may reject conspiracies when official accounts are accessible and trusted, yet endorse conspiracies when official accounts are absent or distrusted and conspiracies are salient [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308), [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full).

#### C. Affect/threat and uncertainty
Uncertainty and threat are consistently implicated in conspiracy endorsement and misinformation spread, partly because they amplify the desire for meaning and certainty [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full), [[15]](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/5273/5273.html). NFC, conceptualized as uncertainty avoidance, should therefore become more influential when uncertainty is salient—*but* representative survey evidence suggests trust can dominate and the expected NCC × trust interaction may not appear [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full).

#### D. Information avoidance and selective exposure
After adopting a belief, high NFC predicts preferential exposure to supporting information and avoidance of challenging information [[9]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656612000815), which can:
- reduce contact with corrections,
- increase polarization of belief accuracy,
- entrench misinformation even if initial acceptance was modest.

---

### 5) Moderators and boundary conditions: when NFC increases vs decreases misinformation acceptance

A central conclusion across theory and evidence is: **NFC effects are conditional**.

#### A. Availability/salience of explanations (a major moderator)
- When conspiratorial explanations are made salient and official explanations are lacking/uncertain, high NFC predicts **greater endorsement** [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308).
- When official explanations are clear and available, high NFC can predict **rejection of conspiracies** (freezing on the official account) [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308).

This implies NFC is best understood as **amplifying the pull of the most closure-providing accessible narrative**, rather than simply amplifying false belief.

#### B. Trust and institutional credibility
Trust in political/medical institutions strongly predicts lower COVID conspiracy belief, while NCC’s effect is small and trust did not moderate the NCC effect in one large representative study [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full). Still, in practice, trust plausibly determines *which* sources can provide closure (official vs alternative).

#### C. Education and cognitive resources
Education is often assumed protective, but newer work suggests traits including NFC can weaken education’s protective association with misinformation susceptibility (at least inconsistently) [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886925005306). Separately, capacity variables like fluid intelligence predict correction uptake in some designs where motivational variables do not [[19]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11411052/), suggesting **resource constraints** can dominate in correction contexts.

#### D. Time pressure and acceleration (state-level analog of closure pressure)
Time pressure reduces discrimination between true and false headlines (lower discernment), even while leaving congruency and familiarity effects intact [[49]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9794823/). NFC theory treats time pressure as a condition that increases closure motivation [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637961/), [[39]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886910004344), so fast feed environments likely increase closure-seeking behaviors even without measuring NFC directly.

#### E. Repetition and familiarity
Repetition increases perceived truth for misinformation, often without moderation by cognitive style and without reliable moderation by NFC [[58]](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51ed234ae4b0867e2385d879/t/5d00198d1c604f0001851247/1560287631560/2019+De+keersmaecker+et+al+-+PSPB.pdf), [[14]](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-devpsych-010923-093547). So even if high NFC sometimes increases careful processing, repetition effects can persist regardless.

---

### 6) Measurement and operationalization: why findings vary so much

#### A. NFC instruments and the “decisiveness problem”
The classic 42-item Need for Closure Scale (NFCS) has five facets (order, predictability, ambiguity discomfort, decisiveness, close-mindedness) [[40]](https://sjdm.org/dmidi/Need_for_(Cognitive)_Closure_Scale.html). A major psychometric critique is that the original **decisiveness** facet partly measures *ability/style* rather than the *motivational need* for closure. Revised items that explicitly assess the need for quick answers improve construct validity and restore a cleaner unidimensional structure [[42]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167206294744). This matters because:
- Studies using different versions (original vs revised vs brief 15-item) may not be measuring the same latent construct [[39]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886910004344), [[42]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167206294744), [[41]](https://www.kruglanskiarie.com/need-for-closure).
- Treating decisiveness as equivalent to closure motivation can distort results.

Short forms (15-item) were developed to avoid idiosyncratic item selection and to preserve facet coverage while remaining one-dimensional [[39]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886910004344).

There is also a distinct instrument capturing **urgency and permanence** tendencies more directly (RT-NFC), aligning tightly with seizing/freezing theory [[44]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.813115/full).

#### B. Cross-cultural measurement invariance
Cross-national comparisons require invariance. Work testing NFCS across Polish, Flemish, Korean, and American samples finds structural invariance and partial metric/scalar invariance, implying some comparability but also that some items behave differently across cultures [[45]](https://psychologicabelgica.com/articles/998/files/submission/proof/998-1-4257-1-10-20200826.pdf). This is relevant because misinformation research is increasingly cross-national (e.g., multi-country COVID misinformation), and partial invariance can contribute to inconsistent associations across settings.

#### C. Outcome measurement: “misinformation acceptance” is not one thing
Findings differ depending on whether the outcome is:
- **endorsement of conspiratorial explanations** [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full)
- **belief in fake news items** [[17]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8740309/)
- **COVID misinformation susceptibility indices** [[57]](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/13385/13385.html)
- **repetition-based truth inflation** [[58]](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51ed234ae4b0867e2385d879/t/5d00198d1c604f0001851247/1560287631560/2019+De+keersmaecker+et+al+-+PSPB.pdf)
- **sharing intentions or behavior** (often influenced by attention and platform design rather than belief alone) [[27]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9082967/), [[26]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9051116/)

Even within headline paradigms, signal detection approaches separate **discrimination ability** from **response bias**, and predictors can relate to one but not the other [[64]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409329121), [[49]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9794823/). NFC might plausibly relate more to *stopping rules/bias* than to discrimination, which could be one reason raw accuracy approaches sometimes show weak effects.

#### D. Design and inference issues
- Cross-sectional self-report designs risk confounding and common-method bias.
- Stronger designs include preregistration and temporal separation (e.g., pre-pandemic NCC predicting later conspiracy belief) [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full).
- Experimental work reveals key person × situation dependencies (salience, official explanations) that cross-sectional work can miss [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308).

### 7) Practical implications: what might reduce misinformation acceptance in high-NFC people or high-closure contexts?

Direct evidence specifically “for high-NFC individuals” is limited in the provided set, but the best-supported implications follow from (i) seizing/freezing dynamics and (ii) the importance of explanation availability and salience.

#### A. Make accurate closure easy to seize (and stick to)
Because high NFC increases adoption of the most accessible closure-providing narrative [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308):
- Provide **clear, coherent, simple explanations early** (to prevent misinformation from being the first-seized frame).
- Ensure official explanations are **salient and easy to retrieve** at the moment of uncertainty.

This follows directly from the reversal effect when official accounts are available: high NFC can *protect* against conspiracies when credible closure is present [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308).

#### B. Avoid “headline-first” exposure patterns where possible
Given high NFC’s vulnerability to crystallizing early impressions when messages are segmented [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5124571/):
- Platforms and communicators should minimize designs where sensational claims are shown without immediate context.
- Corrections should reduce ambiguity quickly and foreground the correct causal story rather than leaving audiences in uncertainty.

#### C. Use correction formats that supply an alternative explanation
General debunking evidence (not NFC-specific) indicates corrections work better when **detailed** and when they provide an **alternative explanation**, and that repeating corrections and reminding people of the misinformation can be beneficial with limited backfire risk [[53]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X23001574), supported by experimental evidence against familiarity backfire [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7447737/). For high-NFC audiences, alternative explanations are especially conceptually aligned because they replace uncertainty with a structured account (closure-compatible).

#### D. Prompts and prebunking: likely helpful, but NFC-specific evidence is sparse
- **Accuracy prompts** improve sharing discernment in many experiments by shifting attention to accuracy, reducing sharing of false headlines in internal meta-analysis, with effects larger among more reflective/attentive participants [[26]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9051116/), and reviewed as a scalable “attention” intervention [[27]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9082967/). These results are not reported as NFC-moderated, so we cannot conclude they are uniquely effective for high-NFC users.
- **Inoculation/prebunking** interventions (e.g., manipulation-technique videos) improve recognition and discernment and improve sharing decision quality across multiple preregistered studies and a field deployment [[34]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo6254). Again, not NFC-targeted, but they may reduce reliance on shallow cues—helpful when closure pressure pushes heuristic uptake.
- A norm-enhanced prebunking approach that boosts actively open-minded thinking reports downstream improvements in discernment and reduced conspiracy beliefs [[35]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210312500099X), potentially counteracting freezing tendencies, though it is not framed as NFC-tailored.

#### E. Warning labels: acceptance may not be lower among high-NFC users
One HCI study found NFCC associated with **more favorable attitudes toward misinformation warning tags** (especially in an MTurk sample), suggesting high-NFC individuals may not reflexively reject labeling interventions and may even prefer them as simplifying cues [[60]](https://escholarship.org/content/qt4h12v5s8/qt4h12v5s8.pdf). However, this is about attitudes toward tags and self-described behaviors, not verified reductions in misbelief.

### 8) Bottom-line answer: what role does need for closure play in misinformation acceptance?

1. **NFC primarily affects misinformation acceptance through epistemic “stopping rules.”** It increases motivation to end uncertainty quickly (seize) and maintain settled views (freeze), which can foster **rapid adoption** and **persistence** of misinformation when misinformation provides salient closure [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637961/), [[2]](https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/socialpsychology/chpt/need-closure), [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full).

2. **NFC is not inherently “pro-misinformation.”** Its effects depend strongly on **which narrative is accessible and closure-providing**. High NFC can *increase* conspiracy endorsement under uncertainty when conspiracies are salient, but can *decrease* it when clear official explanations are available—demonstrated experimentally [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308).

3. **Empirically, NFC’s direct effects on misinformation belief are often small or non-unique.** Large studies find small positive effects on COVID conspiracies [[5]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full), but multi-country models show NFC facets can become non-significant when stronger predictors are included [[57]](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/13385/13385.html), and fake-news belief studies sometimes find null associations [[17]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8740309/). NFC may show up more as a **moderator** (e.g., sometimes weakening education’s protective effects) than as a robust main-effect predictor [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886925005306).

4. **NFC is not a reliable buffer against repetition-driven belief inflation.** Illusory truth effects appear robust and often not moderated by NFC [[58]](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51ed234ae4b0867e2385d879/t/5d00198d1c604f0001851247/1560287631560/2019+De+keersmaecker+et+al+-+PSPB.pdf), consistent with broader reviews emphasizing the broad power of repetition/fluency [[14]](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-devpsych-010923-093547).

5. **The most actionable implication is environmental:** if accurate, trusted explanations are made **salient, coherent, and available early**, high-NFC individuals may freeze on accurate closure rather than misinformative closure [[11]](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/61588/1/Marchlewska%20et%20al.%20Addicted%20to%20Answers%20FINAL.pdf), [[46]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2308). This shifts the focus from “fix the person” to “design the information environment so the easiest closure to seize is accurate.”

If you want, I can (a) diagram the causal pathways (NFC → seizing/freezing → selective exposure / heuristic reliance → misbelief; with moderators like salience and official explanations), or (b) translate these findings into concrete platform and public-health communication design rules for high-uncertainty events.
