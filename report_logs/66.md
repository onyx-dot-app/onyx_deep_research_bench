Query ID: 66
============================================================

QUESTION:
Which Obsidian plugins can effectively replicate Notion's multi-view database functionality (including Table, Kanban, Calendar, and List views)? Please provide a detailed comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of these plugins.

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (5 total):
  #1: Research (as of Feb 2026) Obsidian plugins that provide Notion-like database/table functionality with multiple views over the same set of notes (e.g., Dataview, DB Folder, database/table plugins, Projects, any 'Bases' or 'Database' plugins). For each, capture supported views (table/list/kanban/calendar), data model (frontmatter vs folder), editing capabilities, filtering/sorting/grouping, relations/rollups/formulas, mobile support, and maintenance status.
  #2: Research Obsidian plugins specifically for Kanban, Calendar, and List/task views that can operate over a shared dataset of Markdown notes (frontmatter properties/tags). Include Kanban (Obsidian Kanban, Projects, etc.), calendar/time-based (Full Calendar, Calendar plugin, Day Planner, Timeline), and list/task/query (Tasks, Dataview queries). Note interoperability patterns and limitations when trying to mimic Notion multi-view databases.
  #3: Research common plugin stacks and best-practice patterns for replicating Notion multi-view databases in Obsidian (Table+Kanban+Calendar+List from same records), including strengths/weaknesses, UX parity (drag/drop, quick add), performance, and portability. Provide a comparison rubric and identify which approach is closest to Notion for project management/CRM/content calendar use cases.
  #4: Investigate (Feb 2026) the state of Obsidian core Bases regarding missing Notion views (Kanban, Calendar) and any prominent community plugins that add Kanban/Calendar/Timeline layouts on top of Bases. Capture features, limitations, mobile support, and maintenance status, with citations from docs/forums/repos.
  #5: Investigate make.md and Planner (Bases-powered) as multi-view database alternatives: licensing/pricing, maintenance/activity, and actual support for Table/Kanban/Calendar/List views and inline editing/drag-drop. Also look for other notable multi-view database plugins emerging by 2025-2026 (e.g., Cardboard, Anytype-like 'bases', dashboards) that support table+kanban+calendar over notes.

============================================================

ANSWER:
A Notion “multi‑view database” typically means **one set of records** (rows) with **shared fields/properties**, and then multiple **saved views** over that same set (Table, List, Board/Kanban, Calendar), each with its own **filters/sorts/groups**, plus decent **inline editing**, **quick add**, and ideally **drag‑and‑drop** that writes back to the underlying record fields.

In Obsidian, the closest equivalent is almost always: **“each record is a note”** and **fields live in Properties/YAML frontmatter (and sometimes inline fields)**. The “multi‑view” problem then becomes: *which plugin(s) can render the same note-set as table + kanban + calendar + list and keep edits in sync by writing to the same properties?*

Below are the plugins (and plugin stacks) that can *effectively* replicate that Notion workflow in 2026, with a detailed strengths/weaknesses comparison.

---

## 1) Best “single solution” options (most Notion‑like out of the box)

### A. **make.md (Contexts)** — closest to “Notion database” UX today (active)
**What it covers (views):**
- Contexts provide **List (default), Table, Board (Kanban), and Calendar** views over the same collection of notes, and you can **save different filtered views** within a context [[68]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Context%20Views).

**Data model / schema:**
- A **Context** defines a set of properties and views for a collection of notes (folder/tag/space). It includes common types (Text, Number, Date, Options, Yes/No, Link, Image) and advanced types including **Relation** and **Formula** (plus Aggregate/Object) [[67]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Contexts).  
- This is the most explicitly “Notion-like schema layer” among active Obsidian solutions.

**Editing & UX parity:**
- Strong emphasis on interactive management: table supports column resize/reorder/hide and aggregates [[68]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Context%20Views).
- Calendar supports month/week/day views, creating events via click/drag, and **drag/resizing to edit times/durations** [[68]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Context%20Views).
- Ongoing releases include explicit fixes and improvements for drag-and-drop and calendar/table stability (e.g., calendar drag boundary crash fixes) [[69]](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/make-md).

**Filtering/sorting/grouping:**
- Context UI supports search, filter, and sort [[67]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Contexts) and per‑view customizations and saved views [[68]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Context%20Views).

**Maintenance / viability:**
- Actively developed: release **1.3.4 (Jan 26, 2026)** with frequent commits/releases per ecosystem tracking [[64]](https://github.com/make-md/makemd), [[69]](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/make-md).
- MIT-licensed [[65]](https://github.com/Make-md/makemd/blob/main/LICENSE).

**Key strengths (vs Notion):**
- Most coherent “database product” feel: typed fields, multiple views, saved views, interactive calendar/board behaviors, and relation/formula concepts [[67]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Contexts), [[68]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Context%20Views).
- Active maintenance and visible investment in interaction quality [[69]](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/make-md).

**Key weaknesses / risks:**
- It’s a large “platform-style” plugin; some users report conflicts/performance issues in complex vaults (anecdotal), and you are adopting make.md’s way of organizing work rather than purely native Obsidian constructs (even if data still lives in notes/properties).
- Mobile support is not clearly documented in the captured sources (so treat as “unknown/varies by device” from evidence here).

**When to pick it:**
- You want the **closest Notion database experience** (table+board+calendar+list with saved views) with strong UX and active development.

---

### B. **Obsidian Projects** — perfect view match, but discontinued/archived (high risk)
**What it covers (views):**
- **Table, Board, Calendar, Gallery** views over the same set of notes [[34]](https://marcus.se.net/announcing-obsidian-projects/).

**Data model / schema:**
- Treats a folder (or a Dataview query result) as a project and extracts properties (YAML/frontmatter) into a unified dataset [[34]](https://marcus.se.net/announcing-obsidian-projects/).

**Editing & UX parity:**
- Table allows property editing in place; Board groups by **Status** field and orders by **Priority**; Calendar maps events from a **Date** field and supports creating notes from dates with templates overriding the Date property [[34]](https://marcus.se.net/announcing-obsidian-projects/).

**Major limitation:**
- If you use a **Dataview query as the source**, the project becomes **read-only** (no edit/create notes) [[34]](https://marcus.se.net/announcing-obsidian-projects/).

**Maintenance / viability:**
- Author discontinued it May 2025; removed from community list and can be installed via BRAT; repo archived/read-only mid‑2025 [[8]](https://github.com/obsmd-projects/obsidian-projects), [[80]](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects).

**Key strengths:**
- Historically, this was the “cleanest Notion-style” multi-view implementation (Table+Board+Calendar in one coherent system) [[34]](https://marcus.se.net/announcing-obsidian-projects/).

**Key weaknesses:**
- **Not future-proof**: discontinued/archived and removed from the official plugin directory [[8]](https://github.com/obsmd-projects/obsidian-projects), [[80]](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects).
- Mobile usability is reported as uncomfortable by users (anecdotal) [[56]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/development-for-projects-plugin-needed/101089).

**When to pick it:**
- Only if you’re willing to accept maintenance risk and install via BRAT for an otherwise excellent view model.

---

### C. **Planner (Bases-powered suite)** — integrated multi-view (Calendar/Kanban/Timeline/Task List), but “table” is task-list oriented
Planner is worth calling out because it explicitly aims to deliver a unified Notion-like project/time system.

**What it covers (views):**
- **Calendar**, **Kanban**, **Timeline**, and a **Task List (table-like)** view, all built on **Obsidian Bases** [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner), [[71]](https://sawyerrensel.github.io/Planner/).

**Data model / schema:**
- Items are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter; Planner is powered by Bases [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner).

**Editing & UX parity:**
- Calendar: Year/Month/Week/3‑Day/Day/List layouts (FullCalendar), drag-to-reschedule, click-to-create, recurring event display [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner).
- Kanban: drag-and-drop, configurable columns by any property, swimlanes, WIP limits, virtual scrolling [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner).
- Task List: “table view for managing items”, but editing is described as opening an **Item Modal** (not necessarily cell-inline editing) [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner).
- Claims mobile optimization and drag/drop across views in docs [[71]](https://sawyerrensel.github.io/Planner/) (note: installation status appears time-sensitive across docs vs README).

**Maintenance / viability:**
- Actively presented and evolving, but community-plugin availability appears time-dependent/unclear from provided sources (README says “Coming soon” while docs say install from Community Plugins) [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner), [[71]](https://sawyerrensel.github.io/Planner/). Treat distribution status as “verify in your vault”.

**Key strengths:**
- Very strong “multi-view planning app” direction; rich Kanban/Calendar interactions [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner).
- Bases-backed data ownership (plain notes + properties) [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner).

**Key weaknesses:**
- It’s primarily a **planning/task management suite**, not a general-purpose database system like Notion (e.g., CRM/content library).  
- If you need a classic database **Table view with inline property editing like Airtable/Notion**, you must validate whether Planner’s “Task List” satisfies that (it may be modal-based editing) [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner).

**When to pick it:**
- You want an integrated planner (calendar/kanban/timeline) and your “database records” are essentially planned items/tasks/events.

---

### D. **obsidian-bases-views (third-party Bases layouts)** — adds Board+Calendar (and Gantt) to Bases with editing (promising, newer)
**What it covers (views):**
- Adds **Board (Kanban)**, **Calendar**, and **Gantt** view types to Obsidian Bases with “full editing capabilities” [[75]](https://github.com/AlexandrBukhtatyy/obsidian-bases-views).  
- (List and Table can be provided by core Bases; see next section.)

**Data model / schema:**
- Uses Bases; changes persist to YAML frontmatter [[75]](https://github.com/AlexandrBukhtatyy/obsidian-bases-views).

**Editing & UX parity:**
- Drag/drop rescheduling and resizing events/tasks; changes persist to frontmatter [[75]](https://github.com/AlexandrBukhtatyy/obsidian-bases-views).

**Maintenance / viability:**
- Actively releasing as of **Jan 30, 2026** [[75]](https://github.com/AlexandrBukhtatyy/obsidian-bases-views). Low adoption signals (in snapshot) mean more “early” ecosystem risk than make.md.

**Key strengths:**
- Architecturally clean: extends the official Bases system rather than inventing a parallel database format [[75]](https://github.com/AlexandrBukhtatyy/obsidian-bases-views).

**Key weaknesses:**
- Newer/less battle-tested; fewer community signals than core/popular plugins.
- You still need Bases for List/Table, and you’re relying on a third-party view pack.

**When to pick it:**
- You want to standardize on **Bases as your database layer**, but need Kanban/Calendar now.

---

### E. **Task Genius** — multi-view (list/kanban/calendar/gantt) but task-centric and non-standard license
**What it covers (views):**
- Provides task views including **list, kanban, calendar, gantt** charts [[82]](https://github.com/taskgenius/taskgenius-plugin).

**Data model:**
- Operates on tasks in Markdown notes (“plain-text”), not “records as notes” in the Notion database sense [[82]](https://github.com/taskgenius/taskgenius-plugin).

**License / adoption implications:**
- Uses **FSL-1.1-ALv2** license [[82]](https://github.com/taskgenius/taskgenius-plugin) (not a typical permissive open-source license). That can matter for teams, redistribution, or long-term reliance.

**Key strengths:**
- If your goal is specifically “Notion-like task databases” (multiple task views), it’s very aligned [[82]](https://github.com/taskgenius/taskgenius-plugin).

**Key weaknesses:**
- Not a general note database (CRM/content library) from the evidence here—primarily a task system [[82]](https://github.com/taskgenius/taskgenius-plugin).
- Licensing may be a concern depending on your needs [[82]](https://github.com/taskgenius/taskgenius-plugin).

**When to pick it:**
- Your “database” is mostly tasks and you want multi-view task management.

---

## 2) The “native-first” approach: **Obsidian Bases (core) + Bases view plugins** (most future-proof)

### Core **Bases** (Obsidian core plugin)
**What it covers (views):**
- Built-in layouts: **Table**, **List**, **Cards**, **Map** [[1]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases), [[2]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/views).  
- **Kanban and Calendar are not built-in yet** (they’re on the roadmap as “Planned”) [[45]](https://obsidian.md/roadmap/).

**Data model / portability:**
- Data lives in your Markdown notes’ properties: “All the data … stored in local Markdown files and their properties” [[1]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases).

**Filtering/sorting/grouping:**
- Strong UI: per-view filter/sort; filter groups and conjunction logic; advanced filter editor; multi-sort; grouping (currently one property) [[2]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/views).  
- Table also supports column summaries (sum/avg/min/max etc.) and custom formula summaries [[44]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/views/table).

**Editing:**
- Bases supports viewing and editing file properties and creating new files from the view [[1]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases), [[2]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/views).  
- Formula properties exist (calculated properties) [[4]](https://help.obsidian.md/formulas). Cross-note rollup-like behavior is evolving and may have refresh/performance caveats (per discussion) [[5]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bases-formula-cross-note-lookup-rollup/101990).

**Why Bases is the best long-term “database layer”:**
- It’s core, and view types are explicitly designed to be extended by plugins [[2]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/views), with an official developer guide and API for custom views [[48]](https://docs.obsidian.md/plugins/guides/bases-view), [[49]](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/TypeScript+API/BasesView).  
- Obsidian is explicitly planning **Calendar view for Bases** and **Kanban view for Bases** [[45]](https://obsidian.md/roadmap/).

### Add Kanban & Calendar to Bases *today* via plugins

#### 1) **Bases Kanban (ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban)** — straightforward Kanban layout for Bases
**What it covers:**
- Adds a Kanban layout to Bases: group by any property, drag cards between columns to update the groupBy property, drag reorder cards/columns, add new cards, click to open note [[52]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban).

**Strengths:**
- Very “Notion board” behavior: drag-and-drop updates frontmatter; column order can persist [[52]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban).
- It reuses Bases’ grouping/sorting semantics, keeping the mental model consistent [[52]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban).

**Weaknesses / gaps:**
- Known limitation: **empty columns** display is a frequent pain point (raised in community feedback and issues) [[38]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bases-kanban-plugin/109179), [[53]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban/issues).
- Some rendering/format limitations are noted (e.g., icon()/html() rendering as plain text) [[53]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban/issues).

#### 2) **Bases Kanban View (sil-so)** — Kanban + explicit empty-column controls, but “as-is”
**What it covers:**
- Another Bases kanban implementation with configurable column order, optional “show empty columns”, quick add, templates, subtasks via linked notes [[54]](https://github.com/sil-so/obsidian-bases-kanban).

**Strengths:**
- Explicitly addresses empty columns and includes templating/subtask flows [[54]](https://github.com/sil-so/obsidian-bases-kanban).

**Weaknesses:**
- Author explicitly asks users not to open issues and provides it “as-is” for forking [[54]](https://github.com/sil-so/obsidian-bases-kanban). That’s a support/maintenance risk in practice.

#### 3) **Calendar Bases (edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases)** — Calendar layout for Bases
**What it covers:**
- Adds an interactive calendar layout to Bases (FullCalendar-based). Supports start date property, optional end date for multi-day events, drag-and-drop to reschedule with automatic frontmatter update [[50]](https://github.com/edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases).

**Strengths:**
- Very direct “Notion calendar view” analogue, but powered by Bases filters (so the same dataset can be filtered into multiple calendar views) [[50]](https://github.com/edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases).

**Weaknesses / gaps:**
- Known embedding/rendering issues: date ranges may not display correctly when embedding base files/code blocks; rendering in reading mode/embedded contexts can be problematic (open issues) [[51]](https://github.com/edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases/issues).
- Requires Obsidian 1.10+ (initially early access) [[50]](https://github.com/edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases).

### Overall evaluation: Bases-centric stack (Core Bases + Calendar + Kanban plugins)
**Best for:** people who want **maximum portability and future-proofing** (data stays pure notes/properties) and are okay assembling views from multiple plugins.

**Trade-offs vs Notion:**
- You can achieve Table + List natively and Kanban + Calendar via plugins now [[1]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases), [[2]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/views), [[50]](https://github.com/edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases), [[52]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban).
- But you may hit rough edges (empty columns, embed quirks) depending on which add-on views you choose [[51]](https://github.com/edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases/issues), [[53]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban/issues).
- Relations/rollups are less “first-class Notion” and more “properties + links + formulas + evolving cross-note lookups” [[4]](https://help.obsidian.md/formulas), [[5]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bases-formula-cross-note-lookup-rollup/101990).

---

## 3) Dataview-centric approach (powerful “views”, weaker “database editing” unless you add tools)

### A. **Dataview** — multi-output views from one dataset, but mostly read-only
**What it covers (views):**
- Dataview queries can render **TABLE**, **LIST**, **TASK**, and **CALENDAR** query outputs [[30]](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/structure/). That’s already 3/4 of Notion’s view types (table/list/calendar), plus tasks.

**Strengths:**
- Extremely flexible querying over frontmatter and inline fields [[12]](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/).
- Great for saved “views” embedded in dashboards and notes.
- Calendar query exists (calendar dots by date field) [[30]](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/structure/).

**Weaknesses (big one):**
- Dataview is “about displaying, not editing” and leaves notes untouched (except task checkboxes) [[12]](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/). So it’s not a Notion database editor by itself.

### B. Add “editing” to Dataview tables: **Metadata Menu**
**What it adds:**
- Metadata Menu adds controls and context menu actions to modify frontmatter/inline fields, including inside Dataview tables [[14]](https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu).
- It provides a fileClass system that can generate a **table view listing all files in a class**, with direct editing, filtering, sorting, and saved views [[16]](https://mdelobelle.github.io/metadatamenu/fileclasses/).
- There’s a known pattern to create **editable Dataview tables** using DataviewJS + Metadata Menu API field controls (dropdowns, steppers, etc.) [[15]](https://obsidian.rocks/editing-dataview-tables-with-the-metadata-menu-plugin/).

**Strengths:**
- Turns Dataview from a “reporting layer” into something closer to an interactive database grid (with effort) [[15]](https://obsidian.rocks/editing-dataview-tables-with-the-metadata-menu-plugin/).
- fileClass tables can be surprisingly “database-like”: filters (including regex), per-column operators, saved views, custom sort orders, direct editing [[16]](https://mdelobelle.github.io/metadatamenu/fileclasses/).

**Weaknesses:**
- More setup/complexity than Notion (often requires DataviewJS rather than plain DQL) [[15]](https://obsidian.rocks/editing-dataview-tables-with-the-metadata-menu-plugin/).
- It’s easy to end up with a fragmented UX (some views are editable tables, others are static queries).
- Maintenance is ongoing but maintainer time is limited (“looking for contributors”) [[14]](https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu).

### C. The missing view: Kanban
Dataview does not natively provide a Kanban board view. To add Kanban, you typically use a separate board plugin and try to keep the same source-of-truth fields consistent—this is where friction shows up.

---

## 4) Legacy / high-risk “Notion-like database table” plugins (generally not recommended now)

These can replicate parts of Notion (especially editable tables), but most have serious maintenance risk by 2026.

### A. **DB Folder (Database Folder)**
- Markets itself as “Notion like databases,” editable fields directly from a table view, writing back to notes, and can source notes from folders/tags/links/Dataview queries [[9]](https://rafaelgb.github.io/obsidian-db-folder/), [[10]](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder).
- **But the repo was archived July 28, 2025** (read-only) [[10]](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder).

### B. **DataLoom**
- Advertised as Notion-like databases and supports many cell types; however the feature checklist shows only **Table view implemented** in the captured source, and it is explicitly “no longer maintained” [[42]](https://github.com/decaf-dev/obsidian-dataloom).

### C. **Dataedit**
- Turned Dataview queries into editable tables, but it is explicitly “abandoned” and archived, and even suggests “we have Bases core-plugin now, so you shouldn’t really need this plugin anymore” [[41]](https://github.com/unxok/dataedit).

### D. “Obsidian Database Plugin” (tomaszkiewicz)
- Provides editable embedded tables over folder/tag sources with sorting, templates, link fields, etc. [[18]](https://github.com/tomaszkiewicz/obsidian-database-plugin)
- But the captured repo metadata shows last commit in **2022** (stale risk) [[18]](https://github.com/tomaszkiewicz/obsidian-database-plugin).

**Bottom line:** for long-term Notion-like “database” workflows, these older table database plugins are largely superseded by **Bases** (core) + view extensions, or by **make.md** for a fully integrated experience.

---

## 5) Dedicated Kanban / Calendar plugins (useful, but don’t inherently give you “one database, many views”)

These can still play a role in a multi-view setup, but interoperability is the hard part.

### A. **Obsidian Kanban (mgmeyers)**
- Great markdown-backed Kanban boards [[20]](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban).
- But it’s seeking new maintainers (maintenance risk) [[20]](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban), and there are well-documented interoperability problems when you try to unify it with task/date ecosystems:
  - Tasks date format mismatches requiring dual entry in some cases [[21]](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/issues/969).
  - Tag extraction when converting cards to notes is a known pain point [[22]](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/issues/893).
  - Users report mismatches between Kanban “Done” and Tasks completion metadata like completion dates and custom statuses [[23]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-tasks-and-kanban-plugin-together/56018).

**Interpretation:** excellent board UI, but weaker at being a view over a shared “database schema” unless you heavily standardize conventions.

### B. **Full Calendar**
- Stores each event as a note with special frontmatter; can pull events from note frontmatter or daily note event lists; supports read-only remote ICS/CalDAV [[24]](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-full-calendar), [[40]](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-full-calendar/blob/main/README.md).
- It’s closer to “calendar as a first-class note view” than Dataview’s calendar dots.

**Weaknesses:**
- Users report schema/key collisions and constraints (anecdotal), and release cadence appears slow (latest release 2023, though commits exist later) [[26]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/basically-full-calendar-but-with-more-control-over-what-frontmatter-keys-are-used/101821), [[24]](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-full-calendar).  
- Also: Full Calendar is not inherently a “view of the same dataset used by your table and board” unless you make your schema match what Full Calendar expects.

### C. **Obsidian Calendar (liamcain)**
- Excellent for navigating daily notes; not a general database calendar view [[27]](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin).

### D. **CardBoard**
- Kanban over tasks across vault (date/tag boards), but it’s task-centric (not a generic note database) and appears inactive in the captured stats snapshot [[78]](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/card-board).

## 6) Side-by-side comparison (what actually replicates Notion multi-view databases)

### Most effective “Notion-like multi-view database” solutions

| Option | Table | List | Kanban | Calendar | Same dataset across views? | Inline editing | Drag/drop writes back to fields? | Maintenance status |

## 7) Practical recommendations (what to install depending on your goal)

### If you want the closest “Notion database” feel with minimal assembly
- **Choose make.md** (Contexts). It’s the most direct “one system with multiple saved views” approach, actively maintained, and explicitly supports list/table/board/calendar with interactive editing [[68]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Context%20Views), [[69]](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/make-md).

### If you want maximum portability + long-term Obsidian-native alignment
- Use **Obsidian Bases** as the database layer (Table + List built-in) [[1]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases), [[2]](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/views).
- Add:
  - **Calendar Bases** for Calendar view [[50]](https://github.com/edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases)
  - A Bases Kanban plugin (ewerx or sil-so) for Kanban [[52]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban) (or a view-pack like **obsidian-bases-views**) [[75]](https://github.com/AlexandrBukhtatyy/obsidian-bases-views)
- This gives you a Notion-like multi-view database while keeping the source-of-truth in core properties, and it aligns with Obsidian’s direction (Kanban/Calendar for Bases are officially planned) [[45]](https://obsidian.md/roadmap/).

### If your “database” is primarily tasks (and you want Notion-like task views)
- Consider **Task Genius** for list/kanban/calendar/gantt task visualization [[82]](https://github.com/taskgenius/taskgenius-plugin), but weigh the license implications [[82]](https://github.com/taskgenius/taskgenius-plugin).
- Or consider **Planner** if you want Bases-backed project/time management with rich calendar/board interactions [[70]](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner).

### If you already rely heavily on Dataview dashboards
- Keep **Dataview** for flexible Table/List/Calendar queries [[30]](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/structure/), but add:
  - **Metadata Menu** for editing (fileClass tables and/or DataviewJS editable tables) [[15]](https://obsidian.rocks/editing-dataview-tables-with-the-metadata-menu-plugin/), [[16]](https://mdelobelle.github.io/metadatamenu/fileclasses/).
- For Kanban/Calendar, prefer moving toward **Bases + view extensions** rather than trying to force interoperability across separate “Kanban board files” and “Dataview query outputs”, because the ecosystem shows real friction around shared date/status/tag semantics across plugins [[21]](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/issues/969), [[23]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-tasks-and-kanban-plugin-together/56018).

## 8) Key “Notion parity” gaps to be aware of (regardless of plugin)
1) **True relations + rollups**: make.md explicitly advertises Relation/Formula types [[67]](https://www.make.md/docs/Getting%20Started/Lists%20and%20Databases/Contexts), while Bases has formulas [[4]](https://help.obsidian.md/formulas) but “Notion-style rollups” are more emergent and may require link/property functions with performance/refresh caveats [[5]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bases-formula-cross-note-lookup-rollup/101990).  
2) **One perfect UX across all views**: the most cohesive experiences are **make.md** and (historically) **Projects**; the Bases approach is improving rapidly but still depends on third-party view plugins for Kanban/Calendar today [[45]](https://obsidian.md/roadmap/), [[50]](https://github.com/edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases), [[52]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban).  
3) **Maintenance risk**: Projects and DB Folder are archived/discontinued [[80]](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects), [[10]](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder); Kanban is seeking maintainers [[20]](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban). Prefer actively maintained systems (make.md, Bases ecosystem plugins with recent releases) [[69]](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/make-md), [[52]](https://github.com/ewerx/obsidian-bases-kanban), [[50]](https://github.com/edrickleong/obsidian-calendar-bases), [[75]](https://github.com/AlexandrBukhtatyy/obsidian-bases-views).

If you tell me whether your “database records” are (a) tasks/events, (b) projects, (c) CRM contacts, or (d) content items—and whether you prioritize “Notion-like UX” vs “Obsidian-native portability”—I can propose a concrete plugin set + property schema (status/date fields, templates, relations) that yields Table/Kanban/Calendar/List views from the same records with the least friction.
