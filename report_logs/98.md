ANSWER:
## 1) What “current” non-alcoholic cocktail programs look like (2024–2026), and what templates/techniques they signal

### A. Leading bars/programs (global) and their “tells”
A 2025 World’s 50 Best editorial list is a useful snapshot of where top-tier bars are taking low/no programs right now—especially in *process* (lab tools, distillation, clarification), *savory/umami direction*, and *format strategy* (bottled, canned, on-tap, etc.) [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html).

**Savory / umami-forward & culinary cocktails**
- **The Savory Project (Hong Kong)**: zero-proof section (“Temperance”) emphasizes savory structures. Example: *Strawberry Salsa* uses **in-house strawberry juice**, **kombu sous-vide**, **pink peppercorn**, and **vinegar**, finished with a dehydrated fruit leather garnish (strawberry + tomato) [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html).  
  *Signals:* kombu/umami layering, sous-vide extraction, vinegar as backbone, dehydrations for aroma/texture.
- **Atlas (Singapore)**: *Miss Rouge* is described as “dry and savoury,” built from **alcohol-free spiced spirit**, **basil tea**, **verjus**, **salt**, served over cracked ice in a champagne flute [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html).  
  *Signals:* tea as tannin/aroma + verjus acid + salt micro-dosing to create “dryness” and length without ethanol.

**“Lab technique” bars translating classic templates (Negroni, etc.)**
- **Wild Child (Shawnee, USA)**: uses **vacuum and atmospheric distillation** with a **lab-grade Girovap** to remove alcohol while preserving classic depth (notably a NA Negroni) [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html). Also serves *Best Medicine*: **smoked tea**, **non-alcoholic ginger liquor**, **maple foam** [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html).  
  *Signals:* de-alcoholization by distillation; tea smoke + foam as structure.
- **Thunderbolt (Los Angeles)**: uses lab equipment; specifically **centrifuge clarification** (clarified strawberry juice) in a fizzy NA drink and sells it **to-go as a canned cocktail** [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html).  
  *Signals:* clarification for brightness + stability; carbonation + RTD packaging as a core strategy.

**Bottled / pre-batched preservation and speed**
- **Angelita (Madrid)**: launched **pre-bottled zero-ABV creations (2024)**; bottling is explicitly framed as preserving fresh garden components [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html). Example *Green Tomato and Piparra*: a “Zamoran ginger beer” balancing **green tomato herbal acidity** and **piparra pepper heat** [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html).  
  *Signals:* bottled NA menu; ginger beer as structure + heat; savory produce acids.
  
**Low/no versions of classics (menu architecture)**
- **Three Sheets (London)**: offers NA versions of **Negroni, Whisky Sour, Americano, Espresso Martini** using Opius “elixirs” [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html).  
  *Signals:* customers still want recognizable classic *templates*, but NA bases must be supported with texture, acid, bitterness.

**Fermentation as a bar component**
- **Hero Bar (Nairobi)**: lists **house-made kombucha** with seasonal flavors [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html). NA cocktail example *Sergeant Pepperfield* uses homemade strawberry purée, ginger, black pepper, maple syrup, and flamed rosemary [[1]](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/incredible-bars-with-low-and-no-alcohol-cocktails.html).  
  *Signals:* fermentation as complexity + carbonation; spice/aroma theatre.

---

### B. Dedicated no/low spaces + events shaping “what good looks like”
- **Listen Bar (NYC + traveling pop-up)** positions itself as “All bar. No booze.” and runs education/events [[2]](https://www.listen.bar/). Their **Good AF Awards** (NYC) are a strong “bar community” signal:  
  - 2024 winner: **Leyenda** with an alcohol-free **hot toddy** described as unmistakably cocktail-like (not “fancy tea”) [[3]](https://www.listen.bar/goodaf-2024).  
  - Competitors highlighted **Ritual Zero Proof** bases across tequila/rum/gin/whiskey/aperitif alternatives [[3]](https://www.listen.bar/goodaf-2024).  
  - Also highlighted an espresso-martini-adjacent **“chai-tini”** built around a family chai syrup, designed to become a **simple 3-ingredient build** once prepped [[3]](https://www.listen.bar/goodaf-2024).  
  *Signals:* warmth formats (toddy) are a key frontier; “syrup-first” modularity; brand partner bases are common but not sufficient alone.
- **Sans Bar (Austin)**: claims early leadership; runs **Sans Bar Academy** and awards that highlight NA innovation [[5]](https://www.thesansbar.com/). Independent coverage notes an annual awards weekend with tastings and brand presence [[7]](https://thesobercurator.com/3rd-annual-sans-bar-academy-awards-weekend/).  
  *Signals:* rapid professionalization (training + awards) and a growing supplier ecosystem.

---

### C. Alcohol-free cocktail bars with explicit templates and menu language
- **The Virgin Mary Bar (TVM)**: explicitly rejects “mocktail” framing; menu is 0.5% ABV or below [[8]](https://thevirginmarybar.com/pages/menu). Their menu shows *template clarity*:
  - **Spritz**: *Tropicalo* (“totally tropical spritz”) and *Silk Roots Spritz* [[8]](https://thevirginmarybar.com/pages/menu).  
  - **Tiki**: *Tiki Street* (Syrah + hibiscus + pomegranate molasses + spices + lime; “tart with a smoky finish”) [[8]](https://thevirginmarybar.com/pages/menu).  
  - **Highball-ish**: *Good Spirits* (Three Spirit Social Elixir + strawberry + lapsang souchong + soda) [[8]](https://thevirginmarybar.com/pages/menu).  
  - **Savory signature**: *Virgin Mary* with **hand-pressed tomato juice** [[8]](https://thevirginmarybar.com/pages/menu).  
  *Signals:* NA menus increasingly mirror classic families (Spritz/Tiki/Highball), but with wine proxies (Syrah), tea smoke, molasses, and tonic structures to restore length.

---

### D. Fine-dining NA cocktails as R&D engines (important for technique transfer)
- **Kato (Los Angeles)** (reported Jan 2024) shows NA cocktails executed with the same seriousness as alcoholic pairings. Examples:  
  - *Melona Colada*: melon + Gewürztraminer juice + fermented milk dessert (nailao/Beijing yogurt) + lime, served as shaved ice in a coupe [[12]](https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2024-01-04/mocktails-nonalcoholic-cocktails-pairings-kato).  
  - *Amazake Swizzle*: amazake + chai + coconut milk + lime + orgeat + float of NA amaro (St. Agrestis Amaro Falso) [[12]](https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2024-01-04/mocktails-nonalcoholic-cocktails-pairings-kato).  
  - *Mandarin Garibaldi*: mandarin + Calpico riffing on Garibaldi lineage [[12]](https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2024-01-04/mocktails-nonalcoholic-cocktails-pairings-kato).  
  The article also notes many NA drinks elsewhere fall into juice+syrup+soda defaults, and that NA “amaro/aperitivo” replication has been more successful than many spirit stand-ins (e.g., praise for St. Agrestis’ Phony Negroni) [[12]](https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2024-01-04/mocktails-nonalcoholic-cocktails-pairings-kato).  
  *Signals:* texture via fermented dairy analogs, swizzle formats, NA amaro as a structural anchor, and “classic-inspired but not imitation” thinking.

## 2) Advanced production methods now commonly applied to NA cocktails (with practical parameters + pitfalls)

This section focuses on **methods that actually change your options** in NA: they let you create bitterness, acid structure, aroma, and texture *without ethanol doing the work*.

### A. Oleo saccharum + “citrus cordial” as a zero-proof power tool
**What it does in NA:** replaces part of what spirits contribute (aroma intensity + a “real cocktail” nose), and enables batching with less waste.

- Oleo saccharum = sugar extracting citrus oils from peels; peel oils hold concentrated citrus flavor distinct from juice [[24]](https://www.corpserevived.com/post/maximizing-citrus-part-1-oleo-saccharums-cordials).
- **Vacuum-seal oleo** (Morgenthaler): peels + **superfine sugar** in vacuum bag; rest **4–6 hours** for oils to dissolve into sugar with no stirring [[25]](https://jeffreymorgenthaler.com/vacuum-seal-oleo-saccharum/).  
  **Pitfall:** using regular granulated sugar can reduce extraction and leave you with “lemony sugar” but little syrup; superfine is emphasized [[25]](https://jeffreymorgenthaler.com/vacuum-seal-oleo-saccharum/).

**Citrus cordial template (oleo + juice)**
- Weigh juice; combine peels + sugar equal to juice weight; rest **6–12 hours**; add juice to dissolve sugar; strain; refrigerate; claimed shelf life “at least a month” [[24]](https://www.corpserevived.com/post/maximizing-citrus-part-1-oleo-saccharums-cordials).  
- Technique notes: peeling (vs grating) reduces oil loss to air and reduces fine solids that shorten shelf life; grating is faster but harder to strain and can reduce shelf life due to solids [[24]](https://www.corpserevived.com/post/maximizing-citrus-part-1-oleo-saccharums-cordials).

**How to use it in NA programs**
- Replace “fresh juice + simple” with a single ingredient (cordial) for speed and consistency.
- Use cordial as the acidic/sweet core, then layer: tea tannin, bitters, saline, carbonation.

---

### B. Acid adjustment (powdered acids + solutions): the biggest structural unlock for NA balance
In NA, sweetness can dominate quickly; acid adjustment gives you *precision* and lets you reduce juice volume (avoids “smoothie mocktail” syndrome).

**Core acids + what they feel like**
- Citric: “citrus” brightness; Malic: crisp green-apple tang; Lactic: creamy/round; Tartaric: bright without citrus flavor [[26]](https://punchdrink.com/articles/acid-adjusting-easy-techniques/).

**Acid solutions (batch-friendly)**
- A recommended starting point: **10% acid solution** (described as 1:10 acid powder to water by weight; example given “1 gram acid powder to 100 grams water”) and dose “one dash at a time” [[26]](https://punchdrink.com/articles/acid-adjusting-easy-techniques/).  
- “Champagne acid” blends (lactic+tartaric) are used to mimic wine-like acidity [[26]](https://punchdrink.com/articles/acid-adjusting-easy-techniques/).

**Acid-adjusting juices to “lime/lemon strength” (explicit formulas)**
Two sources provide concrete targets:
- Per 100 ml examples (citric/malic grams per 100 ml) and optional succinic drops for lime-like complexity [[27]](https://blog.modernistpantry.com/advice/how-to-acid-adjust-juices/).
- Per 1 liter examples:  
  - Pineapple → “lime”: **32 g citric + 20 g malic per liter** [[28]](https://www.specapp.com/blog/2024/11/18/how-to-acid-adjust-juice-for-cocktails-a-guide-for-balanced-bar-programs)  
  - Orange → “lemon”: **52 g citric per liter** [[28]](https://www.specapp.com/blog/2024/11/18/how-to-acid-adjust-juice-for-cocktails-a-guide-for-balanced-bar-programs)  
  - Grapefruit → “lime”: **27 g citric + 13 g malic per liter** [[28]](https://www.specapp.com/blog/2024/11/18/how-to-acid-adjust-juice-for-cocktails-a-guide-for-balanced-bar-programs)  
  (These let you use less juice while keeping brightness.) [[28]](https://www.specapp.com/blog/2024/11/18/how-to-acid-adjust-juice-for-cocktails-a-guide-for-balanced-bar-programs)

**Pitfalls in NA**
- Acid “thinness”: some bartenders find replacing citrus entirely can feel thin; combining acids with juice preserves viscosity [[26]](https://punchdrink.com/articles/acid-adjusting-easy-techniques/).
- Overcorrection: the broader NA landscape is criticized for becoming “acid bombs” when people overcompensate [[47]](https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/23/zero-proof-cocktails-recipes/).

---

### C. Tea and coffee extraction as *tannin + bitterness + aroma* (not just flavor)
Tea and coffee are unusually valuable in NA because they supply **bitterness, tannin astringency, roast notes, and length**.

**Tea (cold brew for smoother extraction)**
- Cold brew iced tea guideline: **10 g loose leaf per 1 L water**, refrigerate **8–24 hours**, then strain [[29]](https://tecompanytea.com/blogs/tea-atelier/choose-the-right-iced-tea-method).  
  Notes: refrigeration is framed as a safety measure; cold brew yields fewer tannins/bitterness and is hard to overbrew [[29]](https://tecompanytea.com/blogs/tea-atelier/choose-the-right-iced-tea-method).  
  *Use case:* clean, floral or herbaceous highballs where you want subtle tannin without harshness.

**Tea (hot brew for expressive intensity)**
- Hot brew iced tea: **10 g/L**, **195–212°F**, brew **5 minutes**, cool then chill [[29]](https://tecompanytea.com/blogs/tea-atelier/choose-the-right-iced-tea-method).  
  *Use case:* when you need backbone to stand up to syrups, acids, and carbonation.

**Tannins to mimic alcohol grip**
- One NA technique suggestion: use over-extracted black tea to replicate astringency; a specific method given is **double the tea bags and simmer 10 minutes** to build tannin/bitterness [[45]](https://www.seriouseats.com/cocktail-science-mocktail-how-to-replicate-the-taste-of-alcohol-in-a-nonalcoholic-drink). (This is a deliberately aggressive extraction—bench-test to avoid swampy bitterness.)

**Coffee (cold brew concentrate)**
- Cold brew guidance: **1:8 coffee:water by weight** (e.g., 125 g/L), brew ~**14 hours** in the fridge, sanitize equipment due to microbial risk emphasis, then dilute concentrate **2:1 to 1:1** with water to taste [[30]](https://counterculturecoffee.com/blogs/counter-culture-coffee/guide-to-cold-brew).  
  *Use case:* NA “espresso martini” styles, coffee highballs, or adding roast depth to stirred NA builds.

### D. Rapid infusion (pressure) and sous vide (temperature): extracting intensity without ethanol dependency
**Rapid infusion via iSi (positive pressure)**
- Process outline: liquid + solid in iSi, charge **two N₂O cartridges**, vent rapidly, then strain [[32]](https://daily.sevenfifty.com/the-science-of-rapid-liquor-infusion/).  
  Flavor effect: tends to extract “bright” top notes more than slow infusion; often needs **more** solid ingredient than traditional infusion [[32]](https://daily.sevenfifty.com/the-science-of-rapid-liquor-infusion/).  
  Pitfalls: pressure varies with fill volume/container, affecting consistency; dried ingredients extract poorly without hydration time [[32]](https://daily.sevenfifty.com/the-science-of-rapid-liquor-infusion/).

**Vacuum (negative pressure) infusion**
- Uses vacuum cycles to drive liquid in/out of solids; note regulatory/food safety concerns in some jurisdictions regarding vacuum packaging/HACCP [[32]](https://daily.sevenfifty.com/the-science-of-rapid-liquor-infusion/).

**Sous vide for consistent syrups/cordials and botanical extractions**
- Cordial approach quoted: equal parts **unstrained juice + sugar**, sealed and cooked **2 hours at 60°C**; claimed bright profiles and consistency (no evaporation in sealed bag) [[34]](https://talesofthecocktail.org/sous-vide-kitchen-bar/).  
- Infusion ranges quoted:  
  - Spices: **130–145°F (54–63°C)** for **90–120 min** [[34]](https://talesofthecocktail.org/sous-vide-kitchen-bar/)  
  - Herbs: **110–120°F (43–49°C)** for **120–150 min** [[34]](https://talesofthecocktail.org/sous-vide-kitchen-bar/)  
- Pitfalls: heat can create “cooked” flavors; herbs are sensitive and can go brown/swampy [[32]](https://daily.sevenfifty.com/the-science-of-rapid-liquor-infusion/).  
- Alcohol boiling caution is discussed in sources for alcoholic infusions [[34]](https://talesofthecocktail.org/sous-vide-kitchen-bar/), but for NA carriers the main concern becomes *cooked notes and food safety*.

---

### E. Rotary evaporation / hydrosols: aroma without alcohol (and a legal workaround)
A VinePair profile explains rotovap use to create **hydrosols** (water-based distillates) from **non-alcoholic base ingredients**, explicitly noting distilling alcohol is federally illegal in the U.S. without licensing [[36]](https://vinepair.com/articles/techniques-vaccum-distillation-miles-macquarrie-kimball-house/).

**Operational parameters provided**
- Suggested: water bath **35–40°C**, condenser **0°C**, pressure about **25 mbar** [[36]](https://vinepair.com/articles/techniques-vaccum-distillation-miles-macquarrie-kimball-house/).
- Example yield/time: cucumber hydrosol run takes **~4 hours** to yield **2 liters** [[36]](https://vinepair.com/articles/techniques-vaccum-distillation-miles-macquarrie-kimball-house/).

**Why it’s big for NA**
- Hydrosols can become your “spirit-like” aromatic chassis or your dilution component (e.g., cucumber hydrosol used as martini dilution for a stiff, lean but cooling profile) [[36]](https://vinepair.com/articles/techniques-vaccum-distillation-miles-macquarrie-kimball-house/).  
- This is one of the few ways to get *real distillate-like aromatic lift* without relying on ethanol as solvent.

---

### F. Clarification: texture refinement, stability, and new formats (including “stirred sours”)
Clarification isn’t just aesthetics; it changes *how* a drink reads (lighter, longer, more “cocktail-like”) and improves batching stability.

**Three clarification routes with real parameters**
A 2025 CLASS article gives detailed banana clarification examples [[38]](https://classbarmag.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1968/Three_ways_to_clarify_cocktails.html):

1) **Centrifuge clarification**
- Banana puree + **Pectinex at 2 g per 1 kg banana**, rest **10 min**, spin **10 min at 5,000 rpm**, strain through superbag + coffee filter [[38]](https://classbarmag.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1968/Three_ways_to_clarify_cocktails.html).  
  Pitfalls: balancing flasks for safety; equipment cost; yield management [[38]](https://classbarmag.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1968/Three_ways_to_clarify_cocktails.html).

2) **Agar clarification**
- “Golden rule”: **0.2% agar** (0.2 g per 100 g liquid), activate at **85–95°C**, keep mix above **35°C** while combining, set, whisk curds, strain for hours, polish [[38]](https://classbarmag.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1968/Three_ways_to_clarify_cocktails.html).  
  Pitfall: lower yield + time; needs careful temperature control [[38]](https://classbarmag.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1968/Three_ways_to_clarify_cocktails.html).

3) **Milk washing**
- Example: banana blend + acid + hot milk, curdle, rest, chill, strain; recirculate early cloudy portion [[38]](https://classbarmag.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1968/Three_ways_to_clarify_cocktails.html).  
  Pitfall: takes time; changes acidity and may need adjustment [[38]](https://classbarmag.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1968/Three_ways_to_clarify_cocktails.html).

**Gel clarification mechanics + alternative dosages**
- PUNCH explains agar/gelatin trap solids in a gel network; freeze/thaw vs “quick gel” methods [[39]](https://punchdrink.com/articles/how-to-clarified-cocktail-recipe-drink-science-super-lyan/).  
- Note: PUNCH provides a **0.02%** quick-gel agar dosage [[39]](https://punchdrink.com/articles/how-to-clarified-cocktail-recipe-drink-science-super-lyan/), which conflicts with the **0.2%** “golden rule” in CLASS [[38]](https://classbarmag.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1968/Three_ways_to_clarify_cocktails.html). Treat this as “depends on system” and bench-test.

**Clarified cordials enabling stirred, high-acid drinks**
- VinePair explains clarified citrus lets you make drinks with “Martini texture” but sour brightness, opening stirred applications [[55]](https://vinepair.com/articles/techniques-clarification-high-acid-stirred-drinks-bar-contra-nyc/).
- It includes a clarified strawberry cordial process (pectinase + fining agents + centrifuge) then sugar to **50 Brix**, plus **citric/malic/succinic acids** to match lime-like acidity [[55]](https://vinepair.com/articles/techniques-clarification-high-acid-stirred-drinks-bar-contra-nyc/).
- A clarified lemon cordial recipe is given, including an acidity restore step: **add 22 g citric acid per liter of syrup** to bring acidity to **6%** (“same as fresh lemon juice”) [[55]](https://vinepair.com/articles/techniques-clarification-high-acid-stirred-drinks-bar-contra-nyc/).

---

### G. “Bitters/tincture” intensity without ethanol (glycerin + water extraction, oils)
NA drinks often fail because they lack tiny high-impact “seasoning” elements that ethanol bitters normally provide.

- A non-alcoholic bitters method uses **water + glycerol** as solvent; aromatic bitters example includes spices plus **cinchona bark and gentian**, with **500 mL water + 50 g glycerol**, sous vide **90°C for 1 hour**, strain and refrigerate; shelf life described as **1–2 weeks** refrigerated (or freeze to extend) [[41]](https://www.kevinkos.com/post/alcohol-free-bitters).  
- This same source provides usage examples like soda + orange bitters with “6 dashes” bitters plus saline drops [[41]](https://www.kevinkos.com/post/alcohol-free-bitters).

Another method uses **essential oils + emulsification/solubilizers** (gum Arabic, polysorbate) to create miscible bitters; it emphasizes the general challenge that oils and water don’t mix and warns about shelf-life/preservatives if storing long [[42]](https://www.artofdrink.com/bitters/non-alcoholic-bitters-recipe).

---

## 3) Recreating “alcohol-like” structure in NA cocktails: a practical framework + style-by-style balancing

### A. What ethanol contributes (so you can replace it deliberately)
Ethanol gives:
- **Trigeminal heat/burn** (pain-nerve sensation), not “taste” per se [[45]](https://www.seriouseats.com/cocktail-science-mocktail-how-to-replicate-the-taste-of-alcohol-in-a-nonalcoholic-drink)  
- **Drying/astringent perception** (especially at higher proof) [[45]](https://www.seriouseats.com/cocktail-science-mocktail-how-to-replicate-the-taste-of-alcohol-in-a-nonalcoholic-drink)  
- **Bitterness at ~10% ABV**, and some perceive slight
