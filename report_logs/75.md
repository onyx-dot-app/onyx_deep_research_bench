============================================================

QUESTION:
Could the rapeutic interventions aimed at modulating plasma metal ion concentrations represent effective preventive or therapeutic strategies against cardiovascular diseases? What types of interventions—such as supplementation—have been proposed, and is there clinical evidence supporting their feasibility and efficacy?

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (6 total):
  #1: Investigate clinical evidence for metal-lowering interventions (chelation therapy, binders, exposure reduction) targeting toxic metals (lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury) and iron/copper overload, and their impact on cardiovascular outcomes. Include major trials such as TACT/TACT2, EDTA chelation, phlebotomy/iron reduction, and any guidelines/consensus positions up to Feb 2026.
  #2: Investigate which essential metal ions (e.g., Mg, K/Na, Ca, Zn, Se, Fe, Cu) have the strongest evidence that modulating their plasma/serum levels via interventions (diet, supplements, drugs) affects cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention or outcomes. Summarize key RCTs/meta-analyses up to Feb 2026, endpoints (BP, arrhythmias, MI/stroke, HF), baseline deficiency dependence, and safety.
  #3: Compile proposed intervention categories for modulating plasma metal ions relevant to cardiovascular disease: supplementation/fortification, dietary patterns, pharmacologic modulation (diuretics/SGLT2i affecting Mg/K, phosphate binders, iron formulations), gut-binding agents, dialysis strategies in CKD, and monitoring approaches. Focus on feasibility, mechanism, and which plasma biomarkers are used.
  #4: Research current clinical guidelines/consensus (AHA/ACC, ESC, USPSTF, KDIGO, WHO) up to Feb 2026 regarding metal-ion modulation for CVD prevention/therapy: magnesium, potassium (salt substitutes), calcium, selenium, zinc, iron, and chelation/toxic metals. Summarize recommendations, class/level where available, monitoring and safety cautions (hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, selenium toxicity, calcium supplement CV risk), and gaps.
  #5: Investigate evidence for population-level exposure reduction interventions for toxic metals (lead service line replacement, air pollution/industrial emissions control, smoking cessation, arsenic water mitigation) and whether they show cardiovascular mortality or event reductions (natural experiments, cohort studies). Provide key examples and strength of evidence.
  #6: Investigate clinical trial and meta-analysis evidence (up to Feb 2026) for supplementation with selenium, zinc, copper, calcium, and multivitamin/mineral mixtures on cardiovascular outcomes or validated surrogates. Highlight signals of benefit/harm, baseline status dependence, and whether plasma/serum levels were used for selection or monitoring.

============================================================

ANSWER:
Yes—but only for *some* ions, *some* patient groups, and often through interventions that change intake/exposure rather than “titrating” a plasma level to a cardiovascular (CV) target. The clinical evidence is strongest where (a) the metal/electrolyte has a clear causal role in CV physiology, (b) deficiency/excess is common, measurable, and correctable, and (c) outcome trials exist (e.g., **potassium-enriched salt substitutes** for stroke/CV events, **IV iron** for iron-deficient heart failure, and **toxic-metal exposure reduction**—especially arsenic—linked to lower CV mortality). For many other metals, changing plasma levels is feasible but outcome benefits are unproven or inconsistent, and safety/heterogeneity dominate.

Below is a structured review of **intervention types proposed**, **feasibility**, and **clinical evidence for efficacy** (hard outcomes when available; otherwise validated surrogates).

---

## 1) A practical framing: when “modulating plasma metals” is likely to work

### A. Plasma/serum levels are often *imperfect proxies*
- For **lead/cadmium**, *whole blood* (lead) and *urine* (cadmium) are commonly used exposure biomarkers; body burden can persist for decades (bone/kidney stores) [[24]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.029852).
- For **magnesium**, serum Mg may not capture intracellular/total body status well, yet it’s the standard clinical biomarker and is modifiable [[41]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10206180/).
- For **iron**, circulating biomarkers (**ferritin** and **transferrin saturation (TSAT)**) guide therapy and correlate with functional deficiency in heart failure (HF) trials [[48]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908355).

### B. Interventions succeed most reliably in 3 scenarios
1) **Population dietary shifts** that improve sodium/potassium balance (BP → fewer strokes/CV events) [[3]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105675), [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35944931/), [[57]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249).  
2) **Correcting a well-defined deficiency state** that worsens CV outcomes (iron deficiency in HF) [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03671-1), [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10946839/), [[48]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908355).  
3) **Reducing a proven toxic exposure** with strong epidemiology and mechanistic plausibility (arsenic; likely lead/cadmium) [[24]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.029852), [[84]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841553), [[76]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5837785/).

---

## 2) Essential electrolytes and minerals with the strongest CV-outcome evidence

### 2.1 Potassium & sodium (via salt substitutes and sodium reduction)
**Intervention types proposed**
- **Potassium-enriched salt substitutes** (replace part of NaCl with KCl; discretionary salt in home cooking) [[3]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105675), [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35944931/).
- Direct **potassium supplementation** (tablets) has been studied mainly for BP; outcome trials are rarer [[8]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.015719).
- Policy/food-system approaches (procurement, reformulation) increasingly emphasized by WHO commentary [[55]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11951978/).

**Feasibility**
- Very feasible at population scale (household salt substitution).  
- Monitoring burden is mainly *safety-focused* in high-risk individuals: CKD, or drugs that reduce K excretion (RAAS blockers, potassium-sparing diuretics) [[57]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249), [[56]](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/nutritionlibrary/nugag/policy-actions/nugag-dietandhealth-consultatition-comments-responses-lower-sodium-salt-substitutes.pdf).

**Efficacy evidence (hard outcomes)**
- **SSaSS (China)**: cluster RCT in older adults with prior stroke or hypertension risk; salt substitute reduced:
  - Stroke: rate ratio **0.86** (95% CI 0.77–0.96)  
  - Major CV events: **0.87** (0.80–0.94)  
  - All-cause mortality: **0.88** (0.82–0.95) [[3]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105675)  
  Hyperkalemia events were not increased overall under trial exclusions (serious kidney disease / high-risk meds), but biochemical monitoring was limited [[3]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105675).
- **Cochrane review (2021)** of low-sodium salt substitutes: reduced SBP (~−4.8 mmHg) and DBP (~−2.4 mmHg), and probably reduced nonfatal stroke and CV mortality; blood potassium rose slightly (~+0.12 mmol/L) and hyperkalemia evidence was limited and imprecise [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35944931/).

**Guideline/consensus support**
- **AHA/ACC 2025 hypertension guideline**: potassium-based salt substitutes **COR 2a** (“can be useful”) for adults with or without hypertension, *except* CKD or drugs reducing K excretion where **additional monitoring is probably indicated** [[57]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249).
- WHO endorsement is directionally supportive but explicitly emphasizes *conditionality and safety-evidence gaps*, particularly for CKD stage ≥3b, and notes poor ascertainment/definitions of hyperkalemia across trials [[56]](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/nutritionlibrary/nugag/policy-actions/nugag-dietandhealth-consultatition-comments-responses-lower-sodium-salt-substitutes.pdf). (A separate editorial summarizes WHO’s endorsement and implementation approach) [[55]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11951978/).

**Bottom line**
- **Best-supported “metal ion modulation” strategy for CV prevention at scale** is: **replace sodium with potassium in discretionary salt**, with *risk stratification* for hyperkalemia [[3]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105675), [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35944931/), [[57]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249), [[56]](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/nutritionlibrary/nugag/policy-actions/nugag-dietandhealth-consultatition-comments-responses-lower-sodium-salt-substitutes.pdf).

### 2.2 Iron (IV iron for iron-deficient heart failure)
This is the clearest example where **modulating a metal-related biomarker state** improves meaningful CV outcomes.

**Intervention types proposed**
- **Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose** and related IV iron formulations to correct iron deficiency in HF [[48]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908355), [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03671-1).
- Oral iron is generally less effective in HF (absorption, inflammation-mediated sequestration) and is not the focus of the key outcome meta-analyses in the provided sources [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10946839/).

**Feasibility**
- Feasible in outpatient infusion settings; dosing and safety are guided by **ferritin and TSAT**, with explicit thresholds to avoid overload (e.g., holding therapy at high ferritin/TSAT) in trials like FAIR-HF [[48]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908355).

**Efficacy evidence**
- Symptom/function benefit (classic RCT):
  - **FAIR-HF**: improved patient global assessment, NYHA class, 6-minute walk distance, and QoL vs placebo; serious adverse events similar [[48]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908355).
- Outcomes (hospitalizations; mortality signal uncertain):
  - **2023 meta-analysis (10 trials; n=3373)**: IV iron reduced composite of recurrent HF hospitalization + CV death (rate ratio **0.75**, 95% CI 0.61–0.93) but mortality alone remained inconclusive [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10946839/).
  - **2025 Nature Medicine IPD/meta-analysis (6 trials; n=7175)**: reduced recurrent HF hospitalizations + CV mortality at 12 months (RR **0.72**, 95% CI 0.55–0.89); effect mainly driven by fewer HF hospitalizations; CV mortality HR point estimates favored iron but crossed 1.0 [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03671-1).

**Bottom line**
- **Therapeutic** (not primary prevention): In iron-deficient HF, **IV iron is feasible and improves patient-centered outcomes and reduces HF hospitalizations**, with mortality benefit not definitively proven in pooled analyses [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03671-1), [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10946839/), [[48]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908355). This is a strong “yes” for metal-status modulation as CV therapy—*in a defined subgroup*.

## 3) Interventions with consistent surrogate benefits but weaker hard-outcome evidence

### 3.1 Magnesium
**Intervention types proposed**
- **Oral magnesium supplementation** to correct low intake/low serum Mg, aiming at BP reduction and possibly metabolic/vascular effects [[1]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25129).
- **IV magnesium sulfate** in acute coronary/rehab/revascularization settings to prevent arrhythmias [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6025730/).
- **Dialysate magnesium adjustment** (ESKD) to raise serum Mg and reduce calcification propensity [[51]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6140556/).

**Feasibility**
- Oral supplementation is easy but GI intolerance can limit adherence; in CKD, hypermagnesemia risk must be considered even though the cited CKD trial primarily noted GI events and serious events imbalance [[42]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36749131/).
- Dialysis prescription changes are feasible and inexpensive but require protocolization and monitoring [[51]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6140556/), [[50]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5698078/).

**Efficacy evidence**
- **Blood pressure (general/HTN populations)**: 2024 meta-analysis of 38 RCTs (n=2709) showed modest BP reductions:
  - SBP −2.81 mmHg; DBP −2.05 mmHg vs placebo [[1]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25129)  
  Larger effects in people with **hypomagnesemia** and in treated hypertensives [[1]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25129).
- **Arrhythmia in cardiac settings**: meta-analysis (22 studies) found magnesium sulfate reduced ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias after coronary revascularization/ACS (OR ~0.32 and ~0.42) [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6025730/). (This is not population prevention; it’s peri-procedural/acute care.)
- **Vascular calcification in CKD (hard surrogate imaging)**:  
  - **MAGiCAL-CKD**: magnesium hydroxide increased plasma Mg but did **not** reduce coronary artery calcification progression; more GI adverse effects and numerically more deaths/CV events in Mg group (trial not powered for clinical events) [[42]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36749131/).
- **ESKD functional surrogate**:
  - Increasing dialysate Mg raised serum Mg and improved **T50** (calcification propensity) significantly in 28 days [[51]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6140556/). This supports biological feasibility; it is not an outcomes trial.

**Bottom line**
- Magnesium modulation is **feasible** and produces **small BP improvements** and **context-specific arrhythmia prevention**, but **hard CVD prevention evidence is limited**, and CKD calcification trials are not convincingly positive [[1]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25129), [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6025730/), [[42]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36749131/), [[51]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6140556/).

---

### 3.2 Zinc, selenium, multivitamin/mineral mixtures (general prevention)
These have been proposed widely, but the prevention evidence is largely null for major CV outcomes in well-nourished populations.

#### Zinc
- Meta-analyses show improvements in several cardiometabolic markers (TG, total cholesterol, glycemic/inflammatory/oxidative stress markers), but little/no effect on LDL/HDL and often no BP effect overall; one BP-focused meta-analysis shows a small SBP reduction (~−1.5 mmHg) [[15]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37399684/), [[66]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32090294/).
- **No hard outcomes benefit** is established in the provided sources.

#### Selenium
- Selenium alone: large trials and Cochrane synthesis show **no reduction in fatal/nonfatal CVD events** in generally selenium-replete groups [[64]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/).
- Selenium in mixtures: meta-analysis suggests antioxidant mixtures **including selenium** were associated with lower CV mortality compared with mixtures without selenium (signal depends on mixture composition and subgrouping) [[14]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33053149/), [[64]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/).
- Selenium + CoQ10: small Swedish elderly trial reported lower CV mortality persisting to 12-year follow-up (HR 0.59) but explicitly framed as hypothesis-generating due to small size [[65]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29641571/).

#### Multivitamins / antioxidant formulas
- **PHS II** (male physicians; 11+ years): multivitamin **no effect** on major CV events (HR 1.01) [[68]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1389615).
- **COSMOS** (older adults; 3.6 years): multivitamin-mineral **no effect** on composite CVD (HR 0.98) [[71]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294969/).
- **SU.VI.MAX** (antioxidant mix incl selenium and zinc): **no reduction** in ischemic CVD incidence [[70]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15557412/).
- USPSTF evidence review: vitamin/mineral supplementation provides **little or no benefit** for preventing CVD/death in adults without known deficiencies [[72]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793447); USPSTF recommendation statement: evidence insufficient for most single/paired nutrients (except recommends against beta-carotene and vitamin E for prevention) [[53]](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/umGzAGWUVDPcnmbdYnHf_a).

**Bottom line**
- For **general CVD prevention**, supplement strategies aimed at altering plasma trace metals (zinc/selenium) or using multivitamin mixtures are **not supported by convincing CV outcomes evidence** in the typical well-nourished adult population [[53]](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/umGzAGWUVDPcnmbdYnHf_a), [[72]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793447), [[68]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1389615), [[71]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294969/), [[64]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/), [[70]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15557412/).

---

## 4) Calcium: a cautionary example (conflicting evidence, potential harm)
**Intervention types proposed**
- Calcium supplements (often 500–1000 mg/day) for bone health; proposed CV effects relate to BP, lipid metabolism, vascular calcification—yet signals differ by population and trial design.

**Clinical evidence**
- Older patient-level/trial-level meta-analysis (calcium **without vitamin D**) found increased MI risk: HR **1.31** (patient-level) and RR **1.27** (trial-level) [[67]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671013/).
- A later meta-analysis (12 RCTs) found **no association** with MI, stroke, HF admissions, or CV/all-cause mortality; subgroup analyses did not change conclusions [[9]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37743221/).
- In CKD, calcium loading is a specific concern; KDIGO suggests **avoiding hypercalcemia** and **restricting calcium-based phosphate binders** due to harms and vascular calcification concerns [[38]](https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-KDIGO-CKD-MBD-GL-Update.pdf).

**Bottom line**
- Because evidence is **inconsistent** and CKD guidance explicitly warns about excess calcium exposure, calcium supplementation is **not a reliable “CVD prevention via plasma calcium modulation” strategy** and may be harmful in some settings [[67]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671013/), [[9]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37743221/), [[38]](https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-KDIGO-CKD-MBD-GL-Update.pdf).

## 5) “Metal-lowering” strategies: toxic metals and overload states

### 5.1 Toxic metal exposure reduction (lead, cadmium, arsenic): strongest real-world CV impact
**Intervention types proposed**
- **Source control / policy**: removing lead from gasoline/paint/plumbing; emissions controls; tobacco control; contaminated water mitigation [[74]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10926826/), [[76]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5837785/), [[24]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.029852).
- **Household/community mitigation** (arsenic well testing/labeling and switching) [[30]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3506475/).
- **Industrial closure/emissions reduction** as natural experiments (pollution mixtures incl metals) [[78]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.067602), [[79]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7055118/).

**Efficacy evidence**
- **Arsenic mitigation → lower CV mortality** (best evidence):
  - Bangladesh longitudinal cohort with repeated urinary arsenic measures (2000–2018) and mortality follow-up to 2022: each IQR decrease in urinary arsenic associated with **23% lower CVD mortality** (aHR **0.77**, 95% CI 0.73–0.81); those who went from consistently high to below median had much lower CVD mortality (aHR **0.43**) comparable to consistently low group [[84]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841553). This is strong, long-term, individual-level evidence in a real-world mitigation context.
  - Taiwan time-trend analysis: CHD mortality declined gradually over ~17–20 years after cessation of high-arsenic artesian well water use (supportive ecological reversibility evidence) [[87]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371236/).
- **Lead/cadmium reductions and U.S. CV mortality decline**:
  - NHANES-based analysis estimated that declines in blood lead (−42%) and urine cadmium (−31%) between 1988–1994 and 1999–2004 explained part of the U.S. CV mortality decline; modeled “avoided deaths” attributable to lead and cadmium reductions were substantial (lead ~52 and cadmium ~19 fewer CV deaths per 100,000 person-years) [[76]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5837785/).
  - Within-person declines in blood lead in the Strong Heart Family Study were associated with lower systolic BP (≈−7 mmHg comparing highest vs lowest lead-decline tertiles) and reduced interventricular septum thickness [[74]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10926826/).
- **Emissions control natural experiments**:
  - Coal plant retirements: PM2.5 reductions linked to lower mortality among older adults (natural experiment) [[79]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7055118/). (These studies are not metal-specific but pollution mixtures can include metals.)
  - Local coke-plant closure: reported large drops in CV emergency visits/hospitalizations with measured declines in arsenic in air particulates (again mixture not metals-only) [[78]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.067602).

**Bottom line**
- Interventions that **reduce toxic metal exposure**—especially **arsenic in drinking water**—have the most persuasive evidence for meaningful reductions in CV mortality at a population level [[84]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841553), [[24]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.029852). This is “metal modulation” where *exposure biomarkers* (urinary arsenic; blood lead; urine cadmium) are the targets rather than serum electrolytes.

---

### 5.2 Chelation therapy (EDTA) for atherosclerotic CVD: controversial and not reliably effective
**Intervention types proposed**
- Repeated **IV EDTA-based chelation** regimens; modern hypothesis focuses on chelating **lead/cadmium** rather than “decalcifying plaque” [[22]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.024648), [[21]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822472).

**Efficacy evidence**
- **TACT (post-MI, stable CAD)**: EDTA chelation modestly reduced a composite endpoint (HR **0.82**, P=0.035), but no mortality difference; benefit largely driven by nonfatal events including revascularization; significant dropout/withdrawal occurred [[18]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23532240/).  
  A prespecified diabetes subgroup analysis suggested a much larger benefit (HR **0.59**) [[19]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circoutcomes.113.000663), but subgroup claims required replication.
- **TACT2 (diabetes + prior MI)**: successfully reduced median blood lead by 61% but **did not reduce** major adverse CV events (HR **0.93**, P=0.53) [[21]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822472). This is a critical non-replication despite biochemical effect.
- Systematic reviews note heterogeneity of infusion regimens and outcomes; calls for further research remain, but routine use is not supported [[22]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.024648), [[23]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1282574/).
- Professional/regulatory positions emphasize chelation is indicated for **true heavy metal toxicity**, not as general CV therapy; some medical board statements explicitly say there is no scientific evidence for chelation outside metal toxicity [[26]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4057529/), [[27]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1849937/).
- AHA/ACC chronic coronary disease guidance includes content discouraging supplements broadly and has a chelation section, but the retrieved excerpt does not provide the precise recommendation language [[40]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001168). A prior AHA patient-facing summary suggested chelation was “upgraded” to Class IIb (“probably not effective”), but this is secondary reporting rather than the guideline text [[54]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.010774).

**Bottom line**
- EDTA chelation can **lower blood lead**, but **does not consistently improve CV outcomes** in rigorous trials; given risks, burden, and non-replication in TACT2, it is **not an established preventive/therapeutic CV strategy** [[21]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822472), [[18]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23532240/), [[27]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1849937/), [[26]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4057529/).

### 5.3 Iron overload reduction (phlebotomy/chelation) and CV outcomes
**Intervention types proposed**
- **Phlebotomy** to reduce iron stores (ferritin targets) in atherosclerotic disease [[32]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/205537).
- Standard phlebotomy in hereditary hemochromatosis to prevent systemic complications (cardiac involvement occurs in severe/early-onset cases) [[34]](https://easl.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PIIS01688278220021121.pdf).
- **Iron chelators** (e.g., deferasirox) in transfusional iron overload; cardiac benefit assessed via myocardial T2* [[35]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3945858/).

**Efficacy evidence**
- **FeAST trial (PAD; n=1277)**: iron reduction by phlebotomy did **not** reduce all-cause mortality (HR 0.85; P=0.17) or death+MI+stroke (HR 0.88; P=0.20) overall [[32]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/205537). A later reanalysis suggested benefit in smokers only (subgroup) [[33]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23518844/).
- **Thalassemia myocardial siderosis**: deferasirox noninferior to deferoxamine for improving myocardial T2* over 1 year; EF stable [[35]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3945858/). This supports feasibility for preventing iron-overload cardiomyopathy, but not atherosclerotic outcomes.

**Bottom line**
- Outside clear overload syndromes, **lowering iron stores has not shown consistent CV event reduction** in atherosclerotic disease trials; phlebotomy remains appropriate for hemochromatosis and chelation for transfusional overload, but this is not a general CVD-prevention tool [[32]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/205537), [[34]](https://easl.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PIIS01688278220021121.pdf), [[35]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3945858/).

### 5.4 Copper-selective chelation (trientine): promising for remodeling, not yet outcomes-proven
**Intervention types proposed**
- **Trientine** (Cu(II)-selective chelator) repurposed from Wilson disease, targeting labile copper-mediated oxidative stress/remodeling [[37]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10359575/).

**Efficacy evidence**
- In type 2 diabetes, a 12-month RCT showed trientine reduced LV mass index (MRI) substantially vs placebo; effect correlated with urinary copper excretion [[36]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19172243/).
- Pilot HCM study suggested improvements in strain and atrial function, with non-significant reductions in LV mass/fibrosis markers [[37]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10359575/).
- TEMPEST is designed as a randomized placebo-controlled trial in HCM with LV mass index as primary endpoint (design report; results not in provided sources) [[37]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10359575/).

**Bottom line**
- Copper chelation is **biologically and clinically plausible for cardiac remodeling**, with encouraging imaging endpoints, but it is **not yet an established CVD therapy** with hard outcomes [[36]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19172243/), [[37]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10359575/).

## 6) CKD/ESKD: “metal ion modulation” is constant—but outcome benefits are mixed

### 6.1 Phosphate-lowering (binders/diet) and CV risk surrogates
While phosphate is not a metal, CKD mineral metabolism is inseparable from calcium/magnesium and vascular calcification risk, and phosphate-binder strategies are often discussed under “mineral modulation”.

**Intervention types proposed**
- **Phosphate binders** (lanthanum, sevelamer, calcium acetate) [[47]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7608977/), [[38]](https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-KDIGO-CKD-MBD-GL-Update.pdf).
- **Dietary phosphate restriction** (including avoiding phosphate additives) [[43]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3675851/), [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6340919/).

**Evidence**
- A small CKD trial showed **diet + lanthanum** reduced FGF23 (~35%) in 3 months, whereas diet alone or binder alone did not [[43]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3675851/).
- **IMPROVE-CKD** (lanthanum vs placebo for 96 weeks): no difference in pulse wave velocity, aortic calcification, serum phosphate, PTH, FGF23, or urinary phosphate [[47]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7608977/).
- KDIGO 2017 cautions against calcium loading, recommends monitoring calcium/phosphate/PTH trends and restricting calcium-based binders, reflecting concern for vascular calcification and harm [[38]](https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-KDIGO-CKD-MBD-GL-Update.pdf), [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6340919/).

**Bottom line**
- Mineral modulation is feasible and standard in CKD care, but **binder-driven improvement in CV surrogates is inconsistent**, and trials in normophosphatemia do not show vascular benefit [[47]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7608977/), [[38]](https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-KDIGO-CKD-MBD-GL-Update.pdf).

### 6.2 Potassium binders: control serum potassium to enable CV-protective drugs (indirect CV strategy)
**Interventions**
- **Patiromer** and **sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC)** lower *serum potassium* by gut binding/exchange [[49]](https://bjcardio.co.uk/2021/04/novel-potassium-binders-a-clinical-update-3/).

**Evidence**
- Trials show effective serum K lowering and reduced hyperkalemia recurrence; they facilitate RAAS inhibitor continuation/uptitration (e.g., spironolactone) [[49]](https://bjcardio.co.uk/2021/04/novel-potassium-binders-a-clinical-update-3/).
- However, the clinical update notes **no direct evidence** that these agents improve survival or QoL; benefit is mainly enabling evidence-based HF/CKD therapies [[49]](https://bjcardio.co.uk/2021/04/novel-potassium-binders-a-clinical-update-3/). Hypomagnesemia is a known patiromer adverse effect requiring monitoring [[49]](https://bjcardio.co.uk/2021/04/novel-potassium-binders-a-clinical-update-3/).

**Bottom line**
- This is **plasma ion modulation with clear feasibility** and strong biochemical efficacy, used as a *supporting strategy* for proven CV drugs, not a stand-alone CVD-prevention intervention [[49]](https://bjcardio.co.uk/2021/04/novel-potassium-binders-a-clinical-update-3/).

### 6.3 Dialysis prescription as “device-based electrolyte modulation”
- Dialysate potassium management is crucial due to arrhythmia/sudden death risk; extremes of serum/dialysate potassium gradients can be dangerous; implementation requires frequent monitoring and individualized prescriptions [[50]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5698078/).
- Dialysate magnesium increase improved serum Mg and **T50** (calcification propensity) in a short RCT [[51]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6140556/). Promising biologically, but outcomes trials are lacking.

## 7) Safety, monitoring, and feasibility: what makes these interventions implementable (or not)

### A. Potassium-focused interventions
- Salt substitutes: monitor or avoid in CKD or impaired K excretion; safety evidence is limited in at-risk groups because many trials excluded them [[56]](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/nutritionlibrary/nugag/policy-actions/nugag-dietandhealth-consultatition-comments-responses-lower-sodium-salt-substitutes.pdf), [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35944931/), [[57]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249).
- Potassium binders: monitor **K** and **Mg** (patiromer) and volume status/edema (SZC sodium load) [[49]](https://bjcardio.co.uk/2021/04/novel-potassium-binders-a-clinical-update-3/).

### B. Magnesium-focused interventions
- Oral Mg can cause GI intolerance; CKD trials show biochemical change without calcification benefit and possible safety signals [[42]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36749131/).
- Dialysate Mg adjustment requires protocol and monitoring but is practical [[51]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6140556/).

### C. Iron interventions
- IV iron: requires structured monitoring of **ferritin/TSAT/Hb** to treat deficiency and avoid overload; trials used explicit stopping/holding criteria [[48]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908355).
- Outcome benefits appear concentrated in the first year when repletion dosing is highest [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03671-1).

### D. Toxic metals
- Best strategy is **prevent exposure** (policy, water, emissions, smoking/tobacco control) [[24]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.029852), [[76]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5837785/), [[84]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841553).
- Chelation: should be reserved for **true toxicity** contexts; cardiovascular chelation remains controversial with non-replicated trial benefit [[21]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822472), [[27]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1849937/), [[26]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4057529/).

## 8) Overall answer to your question: are these effective preventive/therapeutic strategies?

### Clear “yes” (with strong clinical evidence)
1) **Potassium-enriched salt substitutes (and sodium reduction)** for **population CV prevention**, reducing stroke and major CV events—*with careful hyperkalemia risk management* [[3]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105675), [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35944931/), [[57]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249), [[56]](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/nutritionlibrary/nugag/policy-actions/nugag-dietandhealth-consultatition-comments-responses-lower-sodium-salt-substitutes.pdf).  
2) **IV iron** for **heart failure with iron deficiency** as a **therapeutic strategy** that improves symptoms and reduces HF hospitalizations (mortality benefit not definitive) [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03671-1), [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10946839/), [[48]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908355).  
3) **Arsenic exposure reduction** (drinking water mitigation) as a **population CV mortality reduction** strategy with compelling longitudinal evidence using repeated exposure biomarkers [[84]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841553), plus supportive time-trend evidence [[87]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371236/).

### Plausible/adjunctive “maybe” (good biomarker effects; limited hard outcomes)
- **Magnesium**: small BP lowering (stronger if deficient), peri-procedural arrhythmia reduction; uncertain long-term prevention and mixed CKD surrogate results [[1]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25129), [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6025730/), [[42]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36749131/).
- **Potassium binders**: strong serum potassium control, enabling RAAS inhibitor therapy; direct CV outcome benefits not established in the cited material [[49]](https://bjcardio.co.uk/2021/04/novel-potassium-binders-a-clinical-update-3/).
- **Dialysate magnesium/potassium optimization**: essential in ESKD; improves functional calcification propensity (T50) but outcomes unknown [[51]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6140556/), [[50]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5698078/).

### Currently “no” for routine CVD prevention (insufficient benefit and/or safety uncertainty)
- **General trace-element supplementation** (selenium alone, zinc, copper) and **multivitamin/mineral** supplementation for primary prevention in well-nourished populations: generally **no CV event reduction** [[64]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/), [[68]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1389615), [[71]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294969/), [[70]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15557412/), [[72]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793447), [[53]](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/umGzAGWUVDPcnmbdYnHf_a).
- **EDTA chelation for CAD**: inconsistent efficacy; biochemical lead reduction does not translate reliably to fewer CV events (TACT2 negative) [[21]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822472), [[18]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23532240/), and professional positions restrict chelation to true toxicity [[26]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4057529/), [[27]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1849937/).

### “Depends / caution” (conflicting evidence)
- **Calcium supplementation**: meta-analyses conflict (signals of increased MI in some analyses vs null in others); in CKD, avoiding hypercalcemia and excess calcium load is emphasized [[67]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671013/), [[9]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37743221/), [[38]](https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-KDIGO-CKD-MBD-GL-Update.pdf).

---

## 9) What’s most promising going forward (based on the evidence gaps highlighted)
1) **Biomarker-guided precision trials**: supplement only those with documented deficiency (Mg, Se, Zn) or high toxic-metal burden—rather than population-wide supplementation. Trials like HF iron therapy illustrate the model (ferritin/TSAT-defined deficiency) [[48]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908355), [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03671-1).  
2) **Outcome trials for toxic-metal lowering** beyond exposure mitigation (e.g., safer, targeted chelation or binding strategies) must demonstrate event reductions; TACT2 shows biochemical success is not enough [[21]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822472).  
3) **Implementation science** for salt substitutes: scalable deployment with CKD identification and monitoring pathways is crucial, consistent with WHO’s conditional stance and AHA/ACC’s CKD caution [[56]](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/nutritionlibrary/nugag/policy-actions/nugag-dietandhealth-consultatition-comments-responses-lower-sodium-salt-substitutes.pdf), [[57]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249).

---

### Net conclusion
Therapeutic modulation of “plasma metal ions” is **already an effective CV strategy in specific, evidence-backed contexts** (K/Na via salt substitutes; iron deficiency in HF; arsenic exposure reduction). Outside these, the approach is often **biochemically feasible** but **clinically unproven**, and sometimes **potentially harmful** if applied broadly without baseline deficiency/excess assessment and safety monitoring (e.g., calcium, chelation, high-dose trace supplements) [[3]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105675), [[11]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03671-1), [[84]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841553), [[67]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671013/), [[21]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822472).
