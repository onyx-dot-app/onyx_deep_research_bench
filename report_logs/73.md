QUESTION:
As a senior elementary school English teacher, I need assistance writing a detailed research paper on a 'New Paradigm of Holistic Empowerment in Elementary English Education and Teaching.' Please provide comprehensive content, suggest relevant keywords, and ensure the paper reflects practical, frontline teaching experience, structured to be helpful for novice teachers.

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (6 total):
  #1: Investigate how recent (2020–2026) scholarship and major organizations define or operationalize 'holistic education' and 'student empowerment' in elementary language/English education; extract core constructs (agency, wellbeing/SEL, identity/voice, equity/inclusion, multilingualism/translanguaging, digital/media literacy) and how these differ from traditional skills-based EFL/ESL approaches. Include references to frameworks like Whole Child, OECD Learning Compass, UNESCO, CASEL, SDGs, and language education standards if relevant.
  #2: Survey 2020–2026 evidence-based pedagogies for elementary English that align with holistic empowerment: SEL-integrated language learning, culturally sustaining pedagogy, UDL/inclusive practices, communicative language teaching, task-based/project-based learning, multiliteracies, translanguaging, formative assessment, trauma-informed teaching. Focus on actionable findings and classroom implications for frontline teachers.
  #3: Find or synthesize an organizing theoretical/pedagogical model suitable for novice elementary English teachers: map empowerment outcomes to language domains and whole-child domains, propose dimensions/principles/mechanisms, and identify any existing logic models, competency frameworks, or rubric systems used in language education that integrate agency/SEL/intercultural competence.
  #4: Research practical classroom practices and lesson structures (2020–2026) that operationalize holistic empowerment in elementary English/EFL/ESL, including routines, teacher moves, differentiation for mixed proficiency/large classes, trauma-informed and inclusive classroom management, family/parent communication, and examples by grade bands (K–2, 3–4, 5–6). Prioritize practitioner-oriented sources (TESOL, ELT journals, teacher guides) and empirical studies that provide concrete strategies.
  #5: Research assessment approaches (2020–2026) for elementary English aligned to holistic empowerment: formative assessment, performance-based assessment, portfolios, self/peer assessment, SEL/agency rubrics, intercultural competence assessment, observation checklists; also how to balance standardized benchmarks with empowerment indicators. Provide examples of tools/templates or descriptor frameworks usable by novice teachers.
  #6: Research implementation guidance and professional growth for novice elementary English teachers adopting a holistic empowerment paradigm, including common pitfalls, coaching/PLC supports, equity considerations, inclusive and ethical use of edtech and generative AI in language teaching (2023–2026), student data privacy, accessibility/UDL, and suggested keyword lists for database searching and indexing.

ANSWER:
## Abstract  
A 2026 “new paradigm” of **Holistic Empowerment** in elementary English education reframes English not only as a set of language skills (vocabulary/grammar/phonics) but as a **whole-child, identity-affirming, agency-building, equity-oriented, and wellbeing-protective** learning experience. Drawing on whole-child schooling [[1]](https://www.ascd.org/whole-child)[[2]](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/siteASCD/publications/wholechild/WC-One-Pager.pdf), student agency and co-agency [[3]](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/tools/oecd-learning-compass-2030.html)[[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf), social-emotional learning (SEL) competencies [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/), life-skills empowerment dimensions [[16]](https://www.unicef.org/india/media/2571/file/Comprehensive-lifeskills-framework.pdf), inclusive design for learner variability (UDL) [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)[[52]](https://avidopenaccess.org/resource/cast-releases-universal-design-for-learning-guidelines-3-0/), multilingual asset-based development (WIDA) [[9]](https://wida.wisc.edu/teach/standards/eld)[[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf), action-oriented/plurilingual language education (CEFR/ELP) [[11]](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages)[[12]](https://www.coe.int/en/web/lang-migrants/european-language-portfolio-elp-)[[34]](https://rm.coe.int/cefr-companion-volume-with-new-descriptors-2018/1680787989)[[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd), and practical guidance on trauma-informed schooling and family engagement [[22]](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1464486.pdf)[[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf)[[24]](https://wida.wisc.edu/teach/engagement)[[25]](https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/communicating-ell-families-10-strategies-schools), this paper proposes an operational definition, an organizing framework (logic model), and classroom-ready practices and assessment tools tailored to real elementary constraints (large classes, mixed proficiency, limited time, exam pressure). It is written to be directly usable by novice teachers: what to do Monday morning, what routines to build, what to say, how to differentiate, how to document growth, and how to use edtech/AI ethically with children.

## 1. Defining “Holistic Empowerment” in 2026 Elementary English (and how it differs from traditional skill-based instruction)

### 1.1 Working definition (classroom-operational)
**Holistic Empowerment in elementary English education** is an approach in which English learning systematically develops:
1) **Communicative competence** (listening/speaking/reading/writing + multimodal communication),  
2) **Learner agency** (goal-setting, reflection, responsible action, choice-with-support), and **co-agency** (learning co-constructed with teachers/peers/families) [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf),  
3) **Wellbeing and SEL** (identity, emotion regulation, relationships, ethical decisions) [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/),  
4) **Equity and inclusion** (barrier removal via UDL; culturally and linguistically sustaining learning; anti-bias and access supports) [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)[[52]](https://avidopenaccess.org/resource/cast-releases-universal-design-for-learning-guidelines-3-0/)[[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf),  
5) **Identity, voice, belonging** (students’ languages/cultures as assets; classroom representation; student voice in learning) [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf)[[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf)[[24]](https://wida.wisc.edu/teach/engagement),  
6) **Intercultural and plurilingual development** (communication across cultures; mediation; plurilingual/pluricultural repertoire) [[34]](https://rm.coe.int/cefr-companion-volume-with-new-descriptors-2018/1680787989)[[12]](https://www.coe.int/en/web/lang-migrants/european-language-portfolio-elp-)[[14]](https://www.actfl.org/uploads/files/general/Resources-Publications/Can-Do-Introduction-2020.pdf),  
7) **Digital/media competence with safeguards** (ethical, safe, privacy-protecting technology use; AI literacy in age-appropriate ways) [[44]](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386693)[[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education)[[46]](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/aiincalifornia.asp)[[53]](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/).

This definition intentionally treats empowerment as **both outcome and process**—consistent with OECD’s framing of agency as capacity to set goals, reflect, and act responsibly to effect change, not merely “voice/choice” [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf).

### 1.2 What is “new” about the paradigm in 2026?
The shift is not “adding fun activities.” It is a structural change in **what counts as success** and **how learning is organized**:

- **From narrow academic achievement → whole-child success.** ASCD’s whole-child approach explicitly shifts from narrowly defined achievement to long-term development: healthy, safe, engaged, supported, challenged [[1]](https://www.ascd.org/whole-child)[[2]](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/siteASCD/publications/wholechild/WC-One-Pager.pdf). In English class, that means your lesson plan must include *conditions for safety/engagement/support*, not only language points.

- **From teacher-controlled learning → agency and co-agency.** OECD positions students as needing to navigate unfamiliar contexts and find direction responsibly [[3]](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/tools/oecd-learning-compass-2030.html). Agency is “acting rather than being acted upon” and includes goal-setting, reflection, and responsible action; it must be supported by foundational cognitive and social-emotional skills [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf). So “student-centered” becomes **structured agency** with scaffolds, not laissez-faire.

- **From monolingual ideology → multilingual assets/translanguaging.** WIDA explicitly states multilingual learners’ languages and cultures are valuable resources; leveraging them can develop independence and encourage agency [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf). Research syntheses show translanguaging can foster inclusion, participation, and access (while acknowledging ideology/logistics barriers) [[27]](https://tesl-ej.org/wordpress/issues/volume26/ej103/ej103a4/).

- **From assessment-of-learning → assessment-for-empowerment.** Formative assessment and self-assessment mechanisms become central because they build autonomy, motivation, and learning-to-learn [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12741153/)[[13]](https://www.actfl.org/educator-resources/ncssfl-actfl-can-do-statements)[[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd). This is not optional: in exam-driven contexts, formative routines are a practical pathway to protect motivation and relatedness [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12741153/).

- **From technology as “extra” → technology as ecosystem + ethics.** Policy guidance emphasizes privacy, bias, safeguarding, and a human-centred vision protecting agency, inclusion, linguistic/cultural diversity [[44]](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386693)[[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education). This becomes essential as GenAI enters schools and students’ lives.

### 1.3 Core constructs (with “look-fors” novice teachers can actually observe)

| Construct | What it means in English class | “Look-fors” in real lessons |
|---|---|---|
| **Agency** [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf) | Students set goals, choose strategies, monitor progress, and act responsibly | Students can explain today’s goal; choose between task options; use a checklist; revise using feedback |
| **Co-agency** [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf) | Teacher + students co-create learning process | Class co-writes success criteria; students help model; peer feedback norms |
| **SEL / identity** [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/) | Language learning builds healthy identities and relationship skills | Sentence frames for feelings/opinions; respectful discussion norms; reflection routines |
| **Whole child conditions** [[1]](https://www.ascd.org/whole-child)[[2]](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/siteASCD/publications/wholechild/WC-One-Pager.pdf) | English classroom is healthy/safe/engaged/supported/challenged | Predictable routines; emotional safety for mistakes; cognitively demanding tasks with scaffolds |
| **Equity & inclusion (UDL)** [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)[[52]](https://avidopenaccess.org/resource/cast-releases-universal-design-for-learning-guidelines-3-0/) | Barrier removal through multiple means of engagement/representation/expression | Choice of output modes (oral/poster/video); visuals/gestures; assistive supports; accessible texts |
| **Multilingualism/translanguaging** [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf)[[27]](https://tesl-ej.org/wordpress/issues/volume26/ej103/ej103a4/) | Students can use full repertoire strategically to learn and communicate | Bilingual word banks; L1 planning; mixed-language brainstorming; respectful norms about language use |
| **Intercultural competence** [[14]](https://www.actfl.org/uploads/files/general/Resources-Publications/Can-Do-Introduction-2020.pdf)[[15]](https://www.ateal.ca/documents/1455/Intercultural_Communicative_Competence.pdf) | Students interact appropriately with different cultural perspectives | Compare “big C/small c” practices [[15]](https://www.ateal.ca/documents/1455/Intercultural_Communicative_Competence.pdf); reflect on perspectives; use intercultural can-do reflection [[14]](https://www.actfl.org/uploads/files/general/Resources-Publications/Can-Do-Introduction-2020.pdf) |
| **Digital/AI literacy with safety** [[44]](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386693)[[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education)[[46]](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/aiincalifornia.asp) | Using tools ethically, critically, and safely | Students learn “AI can be wrong”; no personal data; teacher checks outputs; supervised use only |

## 2. What 2020–2026 Evidence Suggests: Pedagogies That Align With Holistic Empowerment (actionable takeaways)

This section translates the research base into “what it changes in your instruction.”

### 2.1 SEL-integrated language learning (why it matters and how it looks)
CASEL defines SEL as developing healthy identities, managing emotions, achieving goals, empathy, relationships, responsible decisions [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/). CASEL also emphasizes students as partners in the educational process—elevating agency—when adults incorporate students’ experiences/cultures and seek their input [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).

**Actionable classroom implications (elementary English):**
- Teach language functions that *do SEL work*: naming feelings, asking for help, apologizing, disagreeing politely, setting goals (“Today I will try…”), reflecting (“Next time I will…”).
- Use “SAFE” design (sequenced, active, focused, explicit) for SEL instruction [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/)—meaning: don’t assume students “pick up” collaboration; teach it explicitly in English routines.
- Treat partner work as SEL + language development: build relationship skills, not just speaking fluency.

### 2.2 Formative assessment as empowerment (not paperwork)
A 2024 review of formative assessment in K–12 EFL reports research focuses on beliefs/assessment literacy, effectiveness of practices, and contextual implementation challenges; it highlights promise in technology-assisted and peer assessment but stresses training and contextual adaptation [[5]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024073985). A quasi-experimental study reports formative-assessment-based instruction improved motivation and achievement, with strong gains in relatedness; autonomy predicted achievement most strongly [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12741153/). This suggests formative assessment is not just “checking learning”—it is a **motivation and relationship intervention** when done well.

**Teacher takeaway:** If you want more confident speakers, do not only “drill more.” Build tight formative loops:
1) clarify goal,  
2) elicit evidence,  
3) feedback,  
4) student revision/reflection,  
5) teacher adjusts instruction [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12741153/)[[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/).

### 2.3 Multilingualism/translanguaging for equity and access
A systematic review of translanguaging pedagogy reports benefits: inclusive environment, increased participation, facilitation of English learning; also notes challenges like adherence to language separation ideologies and logistics [[27]](https://tesl-ej.org/wordpress/issues/volume26/ej103/ej103a4/). WIDA’s guiding principles affirm multilingual learners use their full repertoire (including translanguaging) and that language, social-emotional, and cognitive development are inter-related [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf).

**Teacher takeaway:** In elementary classrooms, translanguaging is often most powerful as:
- a **planning tool** (think in L1 → produce in English),
- an **access tool** (L1 support for instructions/concepts),
- an **identity tool** (valuing home language publicly),
- a **behavior and belonging tool** (rapport, de-escalation) [[27]](https://tesl-ej.org/wordpress/issues/volume26/ej103/ej103a4/)[[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf).

### 2.4 Trauma-informed teaching (essential, not optional)
Trauma-informed practice recognizes trauma impacts learning; it emphasizes consistency, transparency, empowerment, and trust [[22]](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1464486.pdf). WIDA’s 2024 bulletin provides concrete practices: create safe spaces with representation; co-define respect; be human and normalize mistakes; learn triggers; use restorative 1:1 conversations; avoid yelling/public call-outs; use “I” statements; collaborate with families; watch for secondary trauma [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf). Research also warns teachers can experience compassion fatigue/vicarious trauma and need professional boundaries grounded in self-awareness and clear communication [[22]](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1464486.pdf).

**Teacher takeaway:** A trauma-informed English classroom is not “therapy.” It is:
- predictable routines,
- emotionally safe error culture,
- respectful language,
- de-escalation skills,
- referral to professionals when needed [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf).

### 2.5 Inclusive design via UDL: empowerment by design, not by “extra help”
CAST UDL Guidelines 3.0 explicitly state the goal is **learner agency** (purposeful/reflective; resourceful/authentic; strategic/action-oriented) [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/). UDL 3.0 responds to barriers rooted in biases and exclusion systems [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)[[52]](https://avidopenaccess.org/resource/cast-releases-universal-design-for-learning-guidelines-3-0/). Practical implications include optimizing choice/autonomy, fostering belonging/community, cultivating respect across languages/dialects, action-oriented feedback, and accessible technologies [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).

**Teacher takeaway:** UDL is how you make empowerment scalable in large classes:
- plan multiple paths up front (visuals + gestures + sentence frames + choice of output mode),
- avoid designing “one right way” to participate,
- normalize supports for everyone so students don’t feel singled out.

### 2.6 Intercultural/plurilingual competence: language learning for democratic life
ACTFL’s intercultural can-do statements define ICC as interacting effectively and appropriately with people from other linguistic/cultural backgrounds; they emphasize reflection and the iterative nature of intercultural growth [[14]](https://www.actfl.org/uploads/files/general/Resources-Publications/Can-Do-Introduction-2020.pdf). ATESL clarifies “big C” vs “small c” culture and argues cultural aspects of communication must be made explicit, not left to chance [[15]](https://www.ateal.ca/documents/1455/Intercultural_Communicative_Competence.pdf). CEFR Companion Volume expands descriptors for mediation, online interaction, and plurilingual/pluricultural competence [[34]](https://rm.coe.int/cefr-companion-volume-with-new-descriptors-2018/1680787989), aligning with modern communication demands.

**Teacher takeaway:** In elementary English, ICC can be taught through:
- classroom routines of perspective-taking (“In my family…, In your family…”),
- story-based discussions about norms,
- simple mediation tasks (“Tell your partner what the group decided”),
- online interaction norms (if applicable) [[34]](https://rm.coe.int/cefr-companion-volume-with-new-descriptors-2018/1680787989).

## 3. A Usable Organizing Framework for Novice Teachers (Dimensions + Principles + a Logic Model)

Novice teachers need a *map*: what to plan, what to do, what to observe, what to assess. Below is a framework that aligns with major referenced standards and is practical for everyday teaching.

### 3.1 The H.E.A.R.T. Framework (Holistic Empowerment in Action for Real Teaching)
Five dimensions that can structure units, lessons, and assessment:

1) **H — Health, safety, and regulation** (whole-child conditions; trauma-informed) [[1]](https://www.ascd.org/whole-child)[[2]](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/siteASCD/publications/wholechild/WC-One-Pager.pdf)[[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf)  
2) **E — Engagement and meaning** (choice, relevance, play, inquiry; UDL engagement) [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)  
3) **A — Agency and assessment-for-learning** (goal-setting, reflection, formative loops, “I can” checklists) [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf)[[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12741153/)[[13]](https://www.actfl.org/educator-resources/ncssfl-actfl-can-do-statements)[[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd)  
4) **R — Relationships, respect, and intercultural growth** (CASEL; ICC; co-definition of respect) [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/)[[15]](https://www.ateal.ca/documents/1455/Intercultural_Communicative_Competence.pdf)[[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf)  
5) **T — Translingual & multimodal communication** (WIDA; translanguaging; CEFR mediation/online interaction; multiple modes) [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf)[[27]](https://tesl-ej.org/wordpress/issues/volume26/ej103/ej103a4/)[[34]](https://rm.coe.int/cefr-companion-volume-with-new-descriptors-2018/1680787989)[[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)

This framework is intentionally “teacher-friendly”: each dimension can become a column in your lesson plan template.

### 3.2 Principles (non-negotiables) aligned to the research base
1) **Safety before performance.** Students won’t risk speaking if error feels dangerous [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf).  
2) **Agency needs scaffolds.** OECD warns agency strategies can widen gaps without adequate support, especially for disadvantaged students [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf).  
3) **Assets first (language + culture).** Leverage languages/cultures to develop independence and agency; challenge bias [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf).  
4) **SEL is taught, not hoped for.** Explicit competencies and routines (CASEL SAFE) [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).  
5) **Design for variability (UDL).** Plan multiple means; reduce barriers; honor identity [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)[[52]](https://avidopenaccess.org/resource/cast-releases-universal-design-for-learning-guidelines-3-0/).  
6) **Formative loops drive growth.** Evidence → feedback → revision → instructional adjustment [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12741153/)[[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/).  
7) **Families are partners, not recipients.** Engagement is essential for identity, learning, belonging; build trust and break barriers [[24]](https://wida.wisc.edu/teach/engagement).

## 4. Operationalizing the Paradigm: Concrete Classroom Practices Under Real Constraints

This section is intentionally “frontline.” It focuses on routines, teacher moves, differentiation, and grade-band examples.

### 4.1 Lesson architecture novices can reuse (40-minute version + 25-minute version)

#### A. 40-minute “Empowerment Loop” lesson (works grades 1–6 with adjustments)
1) **Warm welcome + regulation (3 min)**  
   - Predictable greeting; quick emotional check-in using simple English/visuals (SEL + safety) [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf)[[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).  
2) **Goal + success criteria (3 min)**  
   - Teacher posts: “Today I can…(task)” and “I will use…(language)” (agency) [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf)[[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd).  
3) **Input in multiple modes (7 min)**  
   - Mini-story, picture sequence, real object, short chant; model target language (UDL representation) [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).  
4) **Guided practice (8 min)**  
   - Choral + pair practice with sentence frames; teacher circulates to collect evidence (formative) [[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/).  
5) **Communicative task (12 min)**  
   - Information gap / roleplay / mini-project step; students choose roles or output mode (agency + engagement) [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf)[[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).  
6) **Feedback + revise (5 min)**  
   - 1 glow + 1 grow; quick re-try (formative loop) [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12741153/)[[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/).  
7) **Reflection + exit ticket (2 min)**  
   - Students self-assess “I can” + choose next goal; teacher notes who needs scaffolds (agency) [[13]](https://www.actfl.org/educator-resources/ncssfl-actfl-can-do-statements)[[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd).

#### B. 25-minute “Micro-loop” (for limited time)
- Greet/check-in (2) → Goal (2) → Input (5) → Task (10) → Feedback/retry (4) → Exit reflection (2).  
This keeps the empowerment cycle intact even when time is short.

### 4.2 High-leverage teacher routines (simple, repeatable, powerful)

#### Routine 1: Co-construct “Respect looks like…” (first two weeks, then revisit)
WIDA recommends explicitly asking students what respect means to them and co-building understanding to avoid escalation across cultural differences [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf).  
**Practical steps:**
- Show pictures of classroom behaviors (listening, waiting, disagreeing).  
- Teach frames: “Respect is… / Respect looks like… / In my family… / In my country…” (grade-adjusted).  
- Create a class poster with 5 “we” statements.

#### Routine 2: “Mistakes are data” language (error-safe culture)
WIDA suggests teacher shares struggles and normalizes mistakes to help students open up [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf).  
**Teacher script (simple):**  
- “Oops—teacher mistake. That’s OK. Mistakes help our brain grow.”  
Tie to growth mindset language embedded in SEL self-awareness/self-management [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).

#### Routine 3: Restorative 1:1 micro-conference (2–4 minutes)
When behavior escalates, WIDA advises avoiding yelling/public call-outs; use one-on-one, highlight strengths, propose alternative action; use “I” statements [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf).  
**Template:**
1) “I noticed…” (objective)  
2) “I feel/ I’m worried because…”  
3) “You are good at…” (strength)  
4) “Next time, try…” (replacement behavior)  
5) “What do you think?” (student voice)

#### Routine 4: Translanguaging “Bridge” (planned, not chaotic)
From WIDA principles: full repertoire is a resource; translanguaging supports learning and identity [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf).  
**Simple options:**
- **L1 brainstorm → English share**  
- **Bilingual word bank** on desk  
- **Partner support**: one student explains task briefly in shared L1, then both produce English output  
This aligns with translanguaging benefits (participation/access) noted in the review [[27]](https://tesl-ej.org/wordpress/issues/volume26/ej103/ej103a4/).

#### Routine 5: Family connection as a system (not occasional messages)
WIDA positions family/community voices as central; engagement is essential, not an add-on [[24]](https://wida.wisc.edu/teach/engagement). NEA provides practical steps: keep contact info updated, learn preferred channel/time, use translation resources and texting tools carefully, and check privacy policies [[25]](https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/communicating-ell-families-10-strategies-schools).  
**Novice-friendly practice:**
- Week 1: “How can we communicate?” mini-survey (home language; best time; WhatsApp/text/call).  
- Monthly: one positive message + one learning tip.  
- For sensitive topics: professional interpreter rather than auto-translate [[25]](https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/communicating-ell-families-10-strategies-schools).

### 4.3 Differentiation in large mixed-proficiency classes (UDL + formative sampling)

**UDL planning moves** [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/):  
- **Choice of output**: draw + label / speak / act / write.  
- **Tiered sentence frames**:  
  - Level A: “I like ___.”  
  - Level B: “I like ___ because ___.”  
  - Level C: “I prefer ___, but sometimes ___.”  
- **Multiple representations**: gesture, images, realia, mini-video (teacher-controlled).  
- **Action-oriented feedback** (specific next step) [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).

**Formative feasibility move:** rotate your attention. The oral discussion checklist model explicitly recommends focusing on a small number of multilingual learners per activity and rotating across time [[36]](https://supported.com/resource-library/oral-language-discussion-checklist/). This prevents the novice-teacher problem of “I can’t assess speaking because everyone talks at once.”

---

## 4.4 Grade-band activity sets (K–2, 3–4, 5–6): “Holistic empowerment in action”

### A) K–2 (ages ~5–8): Safety, play, identity, and talk as participation

**Developmental focus:** predictable routines, oral language, phonological awareness, play-based interaction, emotion vocabulary, belonging. (Also consistent with IB PYP early learning as holistic and inquiry/play oriented) [[17]](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/primary-years-programme/curriculum/the-learner/).

#### K–2 Sample Unit: “My Feelings, My Classroom”
**Language goals:** greetings; “I feel…”; classroom needs (“Can I…?” “I need…”).  
**Empowerment goals:** self-awareness, help-seeking, relationship skills [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).

**Lesson set highlights**
1) **Feelings circle (2 minutes daily)**  
   - Students point to a feelings card and say (or echo): “I feel happy/sad/tired.”  
   - Teacher validates and models regulation choice: “When I feel tired, I drink water / breathe.” (SEL) [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).

2) **Classroom “help” roleplay**  
   - Teach: “Help, please.” “Can you help me?” “Yes, here you are.”  
   - Pair role cards; students act it out; teacher praises respectful helping (relationships) [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).

3) **UDL expression choice** [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)  
   - After story, students choose: draw favorite part + label OR record a 10-second voice message OR act scene.

4) **Trauma-sensitive move:** quiet corner + predictable script  
   - If a child melts down, use calm tone, avoid public correction, restore later 1:1 (WIDA guidance) [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf).

**Assessment/documentation (K–2)**
- Teacher observation notes: Can the student use greeting? Can they use “I feel…” with support?  
- Simple “I can” stickers chart (student-friendly) inspired by ELP “I can” logic [[12]](https://www.coe.int/en/web/lang-migrants/european-language-portfolio-elp-)[[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd).

---

### B) Grades 3–4 (ages ~8–10): Structured agency, collaboration, multilingual bridges

#### 3–4 Sample Unit: “Our Community Helpers (Interview + Poster)”
**Language goals:** questions/answers; simple present; describing jobs.  
**Holistic empowerment goals:** participation, communication, critical thinking, empathy (life skills) [[16]](https://www.unicef.org/india/media/2571/file/Comprehensive-lifeskills-framework.pdf).

**Project sequence (3–4 lessons)**
1) **Launch (engagement + relevance)**  
   - Students discuss: “Who helps us?” (include family roles; culturally inclusive) [[24]](https://wida.wisc.edu/teach/engagement).  
2) **Question building (agency)**  
   - Students choose 3 questions from a bank + create 1 new question (choice-with-support) [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf)[[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).  
3) **Interview simulation (relationship skills)**  
   - Roleplay interviewer/interviewee; teach polite openers/closings.  
4) **Product creation (UDL choice)**  
   - Poster, mini-book, or short recorded presentation (multiple expression modes) [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).  
5) **Gallery walk + feedback (formative loop)**  
   - Students leave “Glow/Grow” notes with sentence frames; presenters revise one part [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12741153/)[[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/).

**Translanguaging option**
- Home-language interview at home is allowed; student brings notes; then produces English output in class (bridge to access) [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf)[[27]](https://tesl-ej.org/wordpress/issues/volume26/ej103/ej103a4/).

**Assessment/documentation**
- Use an adapted discussion checklist (nonverbal communication, asking clarifying questions, connecting ideas) [[36]](https://supported.com/resource-library/oral-language-discussion-checklist/).  
- Add a student self-reflection: “My goal was… I did… Next time…” (agency) [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf).

---

### C) Grades 5–6 (ages ~10–12): Voice, argument, mediation, digital literacy (carefully)

#### 5–6 Sample Unit: “Classroom Improvement Proposal”
**Language goals:** explain + argue with reasons; polite disagreement; presentation. (Aligns with WIDA key language uses such as explain/argue as prominent uses across disciplines) [[9]](https://wida.wisc.edu/teach/standards/eld).  
**Empowerment goals:** responsible decision-making, participation, collective agency [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/)[[16]](https://www.unicef.org/india/media/2571/file/Comprehensive-lifeskills-framework.pdf).

**Sequence**
1) **Problem finding (student agency)**  
   - Students list classroom issues (noise, fairness, materials). Teacher ensures psychological safety and respectful norms [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf).  
2) **Evidence gathering (critical thinking)**  
   - Simple tally charts or short peer survey.  
3) **Mediation language (CEFR direction: mediation is increasingly central)** [[34]](https://rm.coe.int/cefr-companion-volume-with-new-descriptors-2018/1680787989)  
   - Teach: “Our group thinks… because…” “We agree on…” “Another idea is…”  
4) **Proposal writing (scaffolded)**  
   - Provide a template with tiered sentence frames.  
5) **Presentation + Q&A**  
   - Students practice polite question forms; teacher models respectful disagreement.  
6) **Action step (agency becomes real)**  
   - Class votes and implements one change for 2 weeks; reflect on impact (responsible action) [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf)[[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).

**Digital/AI add-on (teacher-facing first)**
- Teacher uses AI to draft differentiated reading passages or question banks *without using student personal data* and with careful review for bias/inaccuracy [[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education). UNESCO emphasizes protecting human agency, inclusion, linguistic diversity, and privacy; institutions must validate tools [[44]](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386693).  
- If students use tools (optional), do it supervised with strict rules: no personal data; critical checking; citation of AI help (as recommended in readiness/policy tools) [[48]](https://www.cosn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gen-AI-Readiness-Checklist-Master-V1_2.pdf)[[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education).

**Assessment/documentation**
- Performance-based rubric: clarity of claim, reasons/evidence, interaction skills, respectful tone.  
- Self-assessment checklist for writing can be introduced (research shows grade 6 learners can use writing self-assessment checklists that map to rubric dimensions like content/organization/language/mechanics) [[41]](https://www.atlantis-press.com/article/125978246.pdf).

## 5. Assessing Language + Empowerment: Practical, Instruction-Driving Tools

### 5.1 Balancing benchmarks with empowerment indicators (a realistic stance)
A “balanced assessment system” places the most emphasis on formative assessment and uses other measures (interim/summative/screening) within a coherent plan so schools aren’t “data rich but information poor” [[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/). For empowerment-aligned English teaching, the practical solution is:

- Keep required benchmarks (tests, unit exams), but **treat them as one data source**.  
- Build weekly formative evidence + student self-assessment routines that directly drive instruction and motivation [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12741153/)[[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/).  
- Crosswalk SEL outcomes with English outcomes rather than assessing SEL in isolation [[30]](https://d1c337161ud3pr.cloudfront.net/files%2F04c02568-c63a-4ca4-99e7-4f537f79abf7_SEL%20Guideline_Final.pdf).

### 5.2 A simple 3-layer assessment map for novice teachers

#### Layer 1: Daily/weekly formative checks (teacher-led, low prep)
Examples consistent with formative use: entrance tickets, K-W-L, think-pair-share, monitoring discussions, quick-writes—**only formative if you adjust instruction afterward** [[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/).

**Practical routine:**  
- Choose 1 target each week (e.g., asking questions politely).  
- Collect evidence from 6 students per day (rotating) using a checklist [[36]](https://supported.com/resource-library/oral-language-discussion-checklist/).  
- Reteach in small group tomorrow based on notes.

#### Layer 2: Student-facing “I can” descriptors + reflection (agency engine)
- ACTFL Can-Do statements are designed to guide learners in goal setting and chart progress, and are not meant as a one-time checklist or a direct grading instrument [[13]](https://www.actfl.org/educator-resources/ncssfl-actfl-can-do-statements).  
- The European Language Portfolio structure explicitly uses a language biography for goal-setting and self-assessment with evidence in a dossier [[12]](https://www.coe.int/en/web/lang-migrants/european-language-portfolio-elp-).  
- Council of Europe guidance emphasizes that checklists (not the broad self-assessment grid) are the primary self-assessment tool, and descriptors should be task-based, comprehensible, and easy to exemplify [[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd).

**Practical classroom tool (template)**
- “This week I can…” (3 items)  
- “Evidence I will save…” (a recording, a worksheet, a photo of poster)  
- “Next goal…” (choose 1)

#### Layer 3: Performance tasks and portfolios (showing growth over time)
Use end-of-unit tasks: roleplay, presentation, poster + talk, story retell, group proposal. Save artifacts in a folder (digital or paper). This aligns with portfolio logic in ELP (passport/biography/dossier) [[12]](https://www.coe.int/en/web/lang-migrants/european-language-portfolio-elp-).

### 5.3 SEL/agency assessment: ethical, strength-based, multi-source
SEL assessment guidance recommends being comprehensive, balanced, aligned, defensible, ethical; using strength-based approaches; using multiple data sources including self-reports (reflective writing), performance-based assessments, and teacher/peer reports [[30]](https://d1c337161ud3pr.cloudfront.net/files%2F04c02568-c63a-4ca4-99e7-4f537f79abf7_SEL%20Guideline_Final.pdf). UNESCO MGIEP highlights limitations of only self/teacher report (bias, lack of direct behavior measurement, cultural sensitivity) and is developing performance-based SEL measures [[31]](https://mgiep.unesco.org/article/markers-of-progress).

**Practical implication for novice teachers:**  
- Don’t “diagnose” children with SEL scores.  
- Do track **observable behaviors** connected to classroom success: turn-taking, help-seeking, persistence, respectful disagreement—using short rubrics and reflection [[30]](https://d1c337161ud3pr.cloudfront.net/files%2F04c02568-c63a-4ca4-99e7-4f537f79abf7_SEL%20Guideline_Final.pdf).

### 5.4 Ready-to-use tools (adaptable templates)

#### Tool A: Oral Interaction Observation Checklist (discussion)
A one-page checklist format exists with criteria like nonverbal communication, supporting ideas with evidence, asking clarifying questions, connecting to others’ ideas; it recommends rotating focus students because you can’t listen to everyone at once [[36]](https://supported.com/resource-library/oral-language-discussion-checklist/).  
**Adaptation for elementary English:**  
- Replace “supporting ideas with evidence” with “gives a reason” for lower grades.  
- Add “uses sentence frame” as a criterion.

#### Tool B: Writing self-assessment checklist (Grades 5–6)
A validated-development study created a grade-6 EFL writing self-assessment checklist with dimensions: content, organization, language use, mechanics, presentation [[41]](https://www.atlantis-press.com/article/125978246.pdf).  
**Classroom use:** give students 5–8 items only (not 32) to avoid overload.

#### Tool C: Classroom SEL/agency rubric (teacher-created)
CASEL provides a blank rubric template as part of continuous improvement supports [[37]](https://schoolguide.casel.org/rubric/). While it is schoolwide-focused, novices can adapt the template into a classroom rubric (e.g., “Collaboration,” “Perseverance,” “Respectful communication”) aligned to CASEL competencies [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/)[[37]](https://schoolguide.casel.org/rubric/).

## 6. Implementation Guidance for Novice Teachers (pitfalls, coaching path, and ethical edtech/AI)

### 6.1 Common pitfalls (and how to avoid them)

**Pitfall 1: Confusing “agency” with “no structure.”**  
OECD explicitly warns agency is more than voice/choice/autonomy; it is capacity to set goals, reflect, act responsibly [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf).  
**Fix:** Offer bounded choices + clear success criteria + reflection.

**Pitfall 2: Agency strategies widening gaps.**  
OECD notes agency-inviting strategies can benefit advantaged students more unless disadvantaged students receive adequate support [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf).  
**Fix:** Pre-teach participation language; provide roles; use visuals; check comprehension; scaffold heavily for newcomers.

**Pitfall 3: SEL becomes “extra time” or moralizing.**  
CASEL positions SEL as integrated with academics and taught explicitly [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).  
**Fix:** Teach SEL *through* English functions and tasks.

**Pitfall 4: Translanguaging becomes inconsistent and contested.**  
Translanguaging helps inclusion and participation but faces ideological/logistical barriers [[27]](https://tesl-ej.org/wordpress/issues/volume26/ej103/ej103a4/).  
**Fix:** Set clear norms (“We can use L1 to plan; final product in English”) and communicate rationale to stakeholders using WIDA asset language [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf).

**Pitfall 5: Trauma stories overwhelm the teacher.**  
Research describes empathy-based stress (burnout, compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma) and emphasizes professional boundaries, self-awareness, clear communication, and institutional supports [[22]](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1464486.pdf).  
**Fix:** Know referral pathways; avoid savior mentality; maintain boundaries; debrief with professionals.

### 6.2 A realistic professional growth roadmap (first year)

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1–6): Stability + safety**
- Build predictable routines; co-define respect; normalize mistakes [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf).  
- Start one formative tool (exit ticket + teacher notes) [[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/).  
- Build one family communication channel with translation support [[25]](https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/communicating-ell-families-10-strategies-schools).

**Phase 2 (Weeks 7–16): Formative loops + UDL differentiation**
- Add success criteria and “I can” statements weekly [[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd).  
- Add output choice and tiered sentence frames [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).  
- Rotate observation checklist for speaking [[36]](https://supported.com/resource-library/oral-language-discussion-checklist/).

**Phase 3 (Weeks 17–30): Projects + portfolios**
- Run one small project per term; save artifacts in a dossier-like folder [[12]](https://www.coe.int/en/web/lang-migrants/european-language-portfolio-elp-).  
- Add student reflection routines (2 minutes) [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf).

**Phase 4 (Weeks 31–40): Co-agency and leadership**
- Students co-create part of rubric or success criteria; peer feedback with sentence frames [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf)[[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/).  
- Begin basic digital literacy and critical evaluation routines (non-AI first, then cautious AI if allowed) [[46]](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/aiincalifornia.asp)[[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education).

### 6.3 Ethical and inclusive edtech / generative AI use (2023–2026 guidance distilled for elementary)

**Non-negotiables**
- UNESCO calls for a human-centred vision protecting agency, inclusion, equity, and linguistic/cultural diversity; it highlights lack of regulation and data privacy risks and urges validation for ethical/pedagogical appropriateness [[44]](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386693).  
- DfE states evidence is still emerging, risks include inaccuracy, bias, unsafe content, IP issues, hallucinations; teachers must critically check outputs and remain responsible [[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education). It notes teacher-facing use tends to have more immediate benefit and fewer risks [[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education).  
- CDE emphasizes human-centered AI: relationships are foundational and AI must not replace caring educators; warns against overpersonalizing AI and urges balance of learning with/without AI [[46]](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/aiincalifornia.asp).  
- TeachAI stresses reviewing tool agreements, age restrictions, consent, AI literacy, misinformation/deepfakes, and compliance (FERPA/COPPA etc.) [[47]](https://www.teachai.org/toolkit-principles).  
- District readiness guidance includes governance, responsible use policies, training, and data governance structures [[48]](https://www.cosn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gen-AI-Readiness-Checklist-Master-V1_2.pdf).  
- Student privacy offices provide FERPA/PPRA resources; transparency and vetting edtech is a recurring priority [[53]](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/).

**Practical rules for novice elementary teachers**
1) **Start teacher-facing.** Use AI to draft leveled texts or create question banks, then you verify and adapt [[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education).  
2) **No personal data.** Don’t paste student names, profiles, IEP info, or identifiable work into open tools [[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education)[[48]](https://www.cosn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gen-AI-Readiness-Checklist-Master-V1_2.pdf).  
3) **Supervised only for students, if at all.** Follow age restrictions; ensure filtering/monitoring; keep safeguarding central [[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education).  
4) **Teach “AI can be wrong.”** Build critical habits; compare AI output to a trusted source; discuss bias at a simple level [[45]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education)[[46]](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/aiincalifornia.asp).  
5) **Cite AI assistance when used.** Readiness checklists explicitly include expectations to cite GenAI use in content creation [[48]](https://www.cosn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gen-AI-Readiness-Checklist-Master-V1_2.pdf).  
6) **Accessibility and equity check.** Ensure tools don’t widen digital divides; align with UDL and equitable access concerns [[46]](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/aiincalifornia.asp)[[47]](https://www.teachai.org/toolkit-principles)[[50]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2024/08/the-potential-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-equity-and-inclusion-in-education_0d7e9e00/15df715b-en.pdf).  
7) **Deepfake awareness (upper grades).** Teach reporting and ethics, not fear; treat as part of digital citizenship [[47]](https://www.teachai.org/toolkit-principles).

## Practical “Frontline” Appendix: What to write in a novice-friendly lesson plan (template)

**Lesson goal (student-friendly):**  
- “Today I can ______ (task).” (ELP/Can-Do spirit) [[12]](https://www.coe.int/en/web/lang-migrants/european-language-portfolio-elp-)[[13]](https://www.actfl.org/educator-resources/ncssfl-actfl-can-do-statements)[[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd)

**Language supports:**  
- Sentence frames (3 tiers) + word bank (bilingual allowed) [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf)[[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)

**SEL focus:**  
- Choose 1 CASEL competency behavior (e.g., turn-taking; asking for help) [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/)

**UDL choices:**  
- Representation: picture + gesture + short model [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)  
- Expression: speak OR draw+label OR act OR write [[51]](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)

**Formative evidence:**  
- Which 6 students will I observe today? (rotate) [[36]](https://supported.com/resource-library/oral-language-discussion-checklist/)  
- What will I do tomorrow based on evidence? [[29]](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2025/how-to-build-a-balanced-assessment-system/)

**Family connection (monthly):**  
- One message to families: what we’re learning + how to practice (translation support) [[25]](https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/communicating-ell-families-10-strategies-schools)

## Conclusion (what “holistic empowerment” looks like when it’s working)
In a strong 2026 elementary English classroom under this paradigm, students are not only “learning English.” They are becoming **safe risk-takers** [[23]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/FocusBulletin-Trauma-Informed-Considerations-Strategies-Multilingual-Learners.pdf), **reflective goal-setters** [[4]](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/concept-notes/Student_Agency_for_2030_concept_note.pdf)[[35]](https://rm.coe.int/16804932bd), **supported communicators** [[8]](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/)[[9]](https://wida.wisc.edu/teach/standards/eld), and **valued multilingual people** whose identities and home languages are treated as assets [[10]](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/WIDA-ELD-Standards-Framework-2020-Edition-Grades-4-5.pdf). The teacher is not abandoning rigor; rather, they are building rigorous communication through **UDL-designed access**, **formative feedback loops**, and **co-agency**, while protecting wellbeing and equity. The result is a classroom where language proficiency grows alongside agency, belonging, and the capacity to participate responsibly in a diverse, digitally complex world [[44]](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386693)[[46]](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/aiincalifornia.asp)[[34]](https://rm.coe.int/cefr-companion-volume-with-new-descriptors-2018/1680787989).
