QUESTION:
Write a paper on Middle Eastern and North African Films with Transgender Themes. Provide a broad overview with extensive references to both trans theory and film theory, and make sure to include in-depth discussion of at least three films.

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (6 total):
  #1: Compile an up-to-date (through Feb 2026) filmography of Middle Eastern and North African films (fiction and documentary) that include transgender/transsexual/gender nonconforming themes or characters, noting country/region, year, director, brief synopsis of trans theme, and any notable festival/censorship/distribution context; include diaspora productions if relevant and clearly label them.
  #2: Identify core transgender studies frameworks and key theorists (through Feb 2026) most relevant for analyzing screen representations, with emphasis on non-Western/postcolonial and MENA-adjacent scholarship (e.g., trans of color critique, coloniality, Islamophobia, medicalization, legibility, necropolitics), and summarize how each framework can be operationalized for film analysis with citations.
  #3: Survey film theory and cinema studies approaches useful for analyzing transgender themes in MENA cinema (feminist film theory, queer cinema, postcolonial cinema studies, documentary ethics, melodrama/realism, affect, star studies, spectatorship), and find MENA cinema scholarship that intersects with gender/sexuality; provide key concepts and citations.
  #4: Gather film-specific scholarly and journalistic sources (interviews, reviews, festival notes, censorship records) for three anchor films likely to be analyzed in-depth in a paper on MENA films with transgender themes: Joyland (Pakistan, 2022), Facing Mirrors (Iran, 2011/2012), and Be Like Others / Transsexual in Iran (2008). Summarize key production context, reception/controversy, representation debates, and any remarks by filmmakers/cast; provide citable details.
  #5: Expand the working corpus/filmography beyond the initial list by identifying additional MENA or MENA-diaspora films (through Feb 2026) featuring transgender themes/characters or trans-adjacent gender variance (including shorts and documentaries). Include title, year, country/region, director, and relevance; prioritize well-documented works from Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Israel/Palestine, and diaspora.
  #6: Develop a paper architecture: propose an outline and comparative through-lines for a scholarly paper on Middle Eastern and North African films with transgender themes that integrates trans theory and film theory and includes close readings of at least three films. Identify the key arguments each section should deliver and suggest a core bibliography (trans theory + film theory + MENA cinema studies).

ANSWER:
### 1) Scope and definitions: what counts as “MENA films with transgender themes”?

**Region and production.** For a workable corpus, “Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) films” can be defined by **primary production location/industry** (financing, crew base, institutional location) while still tracking **settings** and **diasporic authorship** as crucial to meaning. This matters because many films about trans MENA lives are funded, edited, and circulated through European/North American documentary and festival infrastructures (a condition that shapes what becomes *legible* as “trans” to global audiences). The trans media representation roundtable explicitly flags the problem of **Anglophone monolingualism** and **transnational concept travel**—how “transgender” can become globally legible while also remaking local gender formations in Euro-American terms [[21]](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/download/15592/3196/48053). A parallel methodological caution appears in work on “transgender China,” warning that collapsing varied gender histories into a single “transgender” category holds both **peril and promise** and can generate premature conceptual closure [[27]](https://howardchiang.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/710/2021/09/43-Transgender-in-China-1217.pdf). Those cautions are directly applicable to MENA screen studies.

**Theme and character.** “Transgender themes” here includes:
- films with **explicitly transgender/transsexual protagonists or subjects** (e.g., Iranian documentaries centered on transition, Lebanese documentaries on trans women’s archives);
- films where transness appears through **institutions of sex/gender adjudication** (clinics, courts, clerical rulings), even when the film’s own discourse is couched in “transsexuality” or medical categories (common in Iran) [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf);
- films where gender variance appears as **cross-dressing/passing** or a broader “transgender move” that produces temporary spaces of agency—especially in Iranian cinema under censorship, where gender trespass becomes a recurring narrative technology rather than a stable identity claim [[30]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-23_61c4e7e24d00f_Cross-DressingandGenderTrespassing-TheTransgenderMoveasaSiteofAgentialPotentialintheNewIranianCinema.pdf);
- **trans-adjacent** works focused on drag, genderqueer childhood, or gender nonconformity (included cautiously and labeled as such).

**Fiction vs documentary and the ethics of “truth.”** MENA trans cinema is often documentary-heavy, which raises film-theoretical questions about documentary’s “discourses of sobriety,” “documentary voice,” and persuasion—how films claim to know, explain, and instruct publics [[32]](https://journals.openedition.org/inmedia/1601). These issues intensify when filmmakers must negotiate:
- safety and stigma for subjects,
- the politics of medical and religious “expert” speech,
- and global market “shock” framings (e.g., “sex change in an Islamic state”) that Iranian media scholars identify as a recurrent Western narrative problem [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf), [[31]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/visual-representations-of-iranian-transgenders/6737035B543DF86A9619AC67AB4594E0).

### 2) A working (selective but broad) filmography through Feb 2026  
(Explicitly trans-centered first; trans-adjacent grouped afterward. This is a *working* list grounded in the available sources.)

#### A. Explicit transgender/transsexual subjects and protagonists (MENA and closely linked contexts)

**Iran**
- *Inside Out* (2006, Iran; dir. Zohreh Shayesteh) — documentary with three trans subjects (one trans woman, two trans men), combining intimate testimony with interviews with a cleric, psychiatrist, and surgeon [[81]](https://icarusfilms.com/if-insi).  
- *Be Like Others / Transsexual in Iran* (2008, Iran-focused doc; production listed Canada/UK/US/France; dir. Tanaz Eshaghian) — documentary centered on a Tehran gender reassignment clinic; premiered at Sundance; major international festival circulation [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others).  
- *Facing Mirrors* (2011/2012, Iran; dir. Negar Azarbayjani) — fiction feature: a road-film-like encounter between a working-class taxi driver and a trans man planning surgery; premiered internationally (e.g., TIFF), later released in Iran amid “taboo” discourse [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facing_Mirrors), [[5]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/02/iranian-film-taboo-subject-transsexuals). Critical and festival framing emphasizes its “first Iranian narrative film with a transgender protagonist” [[57]](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors), [[58]](https://www.thefilmcollaborative.org/films/facingmirrors).  
- *Aban* (2022, Iran/France; dirs. Abbas Taheri & Mahdieh Toosi) — short about a 9-year-old transgender girl facing family pressure; festival programming emphasizes identity and children’s rights [[70]](https://moviesthatmatter.nl/en/film/aban/).  
- *My Endless Eclipse* (2024, Iran; dir. Aarabi Bijan) — short: a trans woman fleeing forced marriage and facing trafficking [[71]](https://shortfilmdepot.com/en/film/My_Endless_Eclipse).  
- (*Panah* (2022, Iran; dir. Fatemeh Ghadirinezhadian) appears to be a short about a middle-aged trans “mom” trying to leave Iran; evidence in the current source set is snippet-level and should be verified via authoritative listings before firm inclusion) [[72]](https://www.youtube.com/watch), [[73]](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22409538/).

**Lebanon**
- *Cinema Al Fouad / Cinema Fouad* (1993, Lebanon; dir. Mohamed Soueid) — documentary portrait of a young Syrian trans woman in Beirut raising funds for surgery through cabaret dancing [[74]](https://www.cinemapolitica.org/film/cinema-al-fouad/), [[82]](https://sinematranstopia.com/en/yearnings-and-unfulfilled-dreams-from-the-personal-to-the-political/cinema-fouad-soha).  
- *Treat Me Like Your Mother* (2025, Lebanon; dir. Mohamad Abdouni) — documentary structured as a photographic scrapbook: four Lebanese trans women narrate histories spanning state-funded gender-affirming surgery (1997) to vanished safe spaces; IDFA world premiere context [[14]](https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/a6aa4102-ea72-4f6e-a7f0-21d17dcfd526/treat-me-like-your-mother/).  
- (A short film on a transgender woman in Lebanon associated with Dalal Mawad won the Samir Kassir Award in 2020; title and full bibliographic details are not present in the captured excerpt and require follow-up) [[75]](https://dalal-mawad.com/videos/).

**North Africa / Maghreb and diaspora-linked**
- *The Great Safae* (2014, France production; dir. Randa Maroufi) — experimental “fictional documentary” inspired by a transgender domestic worker linked to the director’s family memory; sources diverge on terms/pronouns and synopsis emphasis, which is analytically revealing in itself [[7]](https://arabfilminstitute.org/queer-arab-films-to-watch-during-pride-month/), [[79]](https://en.unifrance.org/movie/38890/the-great-safae), [[83]](https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/bigreview/article/view/20445/9194), [[84]](https://www.randamaroufi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-franck-dumas-EN.pdf).  
- *Bambi* (2013, France; dir. Sébastien Lifshitz) — documentary portrait of Algerian-born trans showgirl Marie-Pierre Pruvot (“Bambi”); Teddy Award at Berlinale [[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi_(2013_film)). (Not MENA-produced, but centrally about a MENA-born trans subject and relevant for diaspora historiography.)

**Israel/Palestine-related contexts (politically and discursively distinct but often grouped in regional festival circuits)**
- *Her Name Was Zehava* (2024, Israel; dir. Tamar Baruch) — short documentary about a Palestinian trans woman navigating violence and criminalization across the West Bank and Tel Aviv; includes explicit anti-“pinkwashing” intent as stated by the filmmaker in interview [[11]](https://newlinesmag.com/spotlight/her-name-was-zehava-points-a-uniquely-insightful-lens-on-the-human-cost-of-the-occupation/), [[12]](https://otherisrael2024.eventive.org/films/6706a392df70e600651fc659).  
- *The Belle from Gaza* (2024, France; dir. Yolande Zauberman) — documentary about trans women in Israel, anchored in the legend of a trans girl fleeing Gaza to Tel Aviv; premiered at Cannes [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Belle_from_Gaza), [[76]](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/la-belle-de-gaza-review-1235902511/).

**Tunisia**
- *Upon the Shadow* (screened at Tunisia’s largest festival in 2017; dir. Nada Mezni Hafaiedh) — documentary centered on queer and trans precarities; the available source emphasizes trans people being pushed into sex work and criminalization under colonial-era law; exact year needs confirmation from a film listing [[78]](https://www.democracy.community/stories/upon-shadow-film-afternoon-about-living-realities-lgbtiq-individuals-tunisia).

**Egypt (historical prehistory of “sex change” as trope)**
- *Miss Hanafi* (1954, Egypt; dir. Fatin Abdel Wahab) — comedy built around an “accidental sex change operation,” historically significant in Egyptian cinema but best treated as a **gender-switch/surgery trope** rather than transgender selfhood [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Hanafi).

#### B. Trans-adjacent / gender-variance works (cross-dressing, drag, genderqueer memory)
- *The Wig* (2015, Morocco; dir. Karim Boukhari) — short about a young man presenting in feminine attire; the wig as protection and self-expression [[7]](https://arabfilminstitute.org/queer-arab-films-to-watch-during-pride-month/).  
- *Run(a)way Arab* (2018, UK; dir. Amrou Al-Kadhi) — diaspora short interweaving drag performance and genderqueer childhood memory in an Iraqi–Egyptian family context [[7]](https://arabfilminstitute.org/queer-arab-films-to-watch-during-pride-month/).  

(Several other queer Arab film list entries exist in the source set but are not evidenced as trans-specific in the excerpted descriptions and therefore should not be labeled “transgender-themed” without further verification) [[7]](https://arabfilminstitute.org/queer-arab-films-to-watch-during-pride-month/).

### 3) Theoretical framework: transgender studies concepts most productive for MENA screen analysis

A rigorous approach benefits from treating “trans cinema” as **more than representation**—as a field of **mediated embodiment, institutional legibility, and circulation politics**.

#### 3.1. Against the “good/bad representation” audit: trans media studies as method
A key methodological warning in trans media scholarship is that representation critique often collapses into moral scoring (“subversive vs normative”), sometimes imported from feminist or queer theory in ways that can miss trans-specific realities [[15]](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/images/16_61.2billard-zhang.pdf). That critique matters in MENA contexts where:
- “transsexuality” may be framed as pathology/cure,
- transition narratives are embedded in clerical/medical bureaucracies,
- and international circulation invites human-rights spectacle.

A trans-centered methodology asks: **Who is addressed?** **What codes of legibility are demanded?** **How do production constraints and reception contexts shape meaning?** The “holistic” sociology-of-culture approach to trans media proposes analyzing cultural objects via **intention, reception, comprehension, and explanation**—mapping how meaning is produced across producers, audiences, genres, and social worlds rather than extracted solely from the text [[15]](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/images/16_61.2billard-zhang.pdf). Even when we cannot conduct ethnography, this model can organize film analysis around paratext (festival framing, censorship discourse) and textual form (who gets voice, what is shown as evidence).

#### 3.2. Indexicality, recognition, and the double bind of visibility
Trans media studies also highlights **indexicality**—the demand that bodies display the “right” visible indexes to be believed as their gender [[16]](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/images/61.2-infocus.pdf). In many MENA films, this appears as:
- institutional tests (clinic assessments, permits, clerical authorization),
- narrative obsession with surgery as “proof,”
- and cinematic structures that stage confession and verification.

Visibility is a **double bind**: increased recognition can enable extraction of value from trans bodies (festival markets, NGO discourse) without ensuring safety [[16]](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/images/61.2-infocus.pdf). This becomes crucial when analyzing documentaries that circulate globally as evidence of “Islamic repression” or “surprising tolerance,” both of which can reproduce reductive geopolitical narratives [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf), [[31]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/visual-representations-of-iranian-transgenders/6737035B543DF86A9619AC67AB4594E0).

#### 3.3. Medicalization, filtering, and category governance (especially Iran)
Najmabadi’s account of contemporary Iran is indispensable for interpreting Iranian trans films because it details how legal/medical authorities frame sex change as cure for an abnormality (“gender identity disorder”) and how institutions **filter** applicants into “really trans” vs “really homosexual” vs other categories [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf). This filtering is not just repression; it can produce **porous spaces** in which people navigate identity categories through self-narration, creativity, and risk [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf). Iranian documentaries and fiction features frequently stage precisely these scenes of authorization (psych evaluation, clerical opinion, family negotiation), making Najmabadi’s framework directly operational for close reading.

#### 3.4. Necropolitics and the afterlife of trans suffering
Trans of color critique cautions that trans death and violence can become a political resource that “vitalizes” projects such as securitization, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim moral panics, homonationalism, and selective inclusion into rights discourse [[17]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-03-17_5c8eb05cad040_TransNecropoliticsSnorton.pdf). For MENA cinema, this suggests a set of questions:
- When films depict trans precarity (sex work, trafficking, murder, prison rape), how are these images mobilized in international reception?
- Do they invite pity-as-consumption, or do they reframe survival as labor, kinship, or archive?
- Who benefits from these narratives once they circulate?

#### 3.5. Surveillance, borders, and “deception” framings
A surveillance lens emphasizes how gender variance is policed not as identity but as perceived **deception** [[19]](https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/view/3267). In MENA contexts, this can map onto:
- border crossings and migration plots (e.g., shorts about leaving Iran),
- permit regimes and ID documents,
- police encounters and carceral vulnerability (especially in West Bank/Tel Aviv narratives) [[11]](https://newlinesmag.com/spotlight/her-name-was-zehava-points-a-uniquely-insightful-lens-on-the-human-cost-of-the-occupation/).

#### 3.6. Decolonizing trans knowledge production
Decolonial trans studies stresses that decolonization cannot be a metaphor or an academic fashion: it is about material struggles, who benefits from knowledge production, and how institutions profit from trans lives without improving them [[20]](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1539790v). Applied to MENA trans cinema, this means asking:
- Who finances, subtitles, and distributes these films?
- What “human rights” story does the film become in global circulation?
- How does the film avoid (or fall into) civilizational narratives that paint Arab/Muslim societies as uniquely backward while positioning Western spectators as emancipated judges? (A risk explicitly identified in Iranian media representation critique) [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf), [[31]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/visual-representations-of-iranian-transgenders/6737035B543DF86A9619AC67AB4594E0).

### 4) Film theory frameworks that pair well with trans theory in MENA analysis

#### 4.1. Postcolonial, Third Cinema, and censorship-shaped form: the “transgender move”
Kheshti’s analysis of Iranian cinema argues that censorship regimes helped produce a recurring trope of cross-dressing/passing figures and what she calls a “transgender move”: a temporary space of agency and potential created by narrative devices and desired by spectators, not reducible to stable transgender subjectivity [[30]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-23_61c4e7e24d00f_Cross-DressingandGenderTrespassing-TheTransgenderMoveasaSiteofAgentialPotentialintheNewIranianCinema.pdf). This is a powerful bridge between film theory and trans theory because it treats “trans” as:
- a **formal and narrative mobility**, and
- a politically charged space produced by constraints (censorship, nationalism, imperial discourse) rather than only personal identity [[30]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-23_61c4e7e24d00f_Cross-DressingandGenderTrespassing-TheTransgenderMoveasaSiteofAgentialPotentialintheNewIranianCinema.pdf).

#### 4.2. Documentary theory: sobriety, voice, persuasion—and entertainment
Documentary studies highlights documentary as a “discourse of sobriety” with rhetorical force, often positioned against entertainment [[32]](https://journals.openedition.org/inmedia/1601). This matters because many trans documentaries about Iran or Lebanon must negotiate:
- claims to truth and evidence (clinic scenes, expert interviews),
- the ethics of representing vulnerable subjects,
- and the need to remain watchable/marketable on festival circuits that may reward “shock” or uplift.

Documentary “voice” (how a film speaks and persuades) becomes especially salient when films include clerics, psychiatrists, surgeons, and family members as authorities who define trans life [[32]](https://journals.openedition.org/inmedia/1601), [[81]](https://icarusfilms.com/if-insi).

#### 4.3. Queer spectatorship, disidentification, and archival recovery (North African/Egyptian cinema studies)
Shomali’s work on Golden Era Egyptian cinema provides tools for reading queerness as a **reading practice** and spectatorship formation—recovering nonnormative legacies within mainstream texts and resisting erasure [[35]](https://mejduleneshomali.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mew152_01shomali_fpp.pdf). Although her focus is women’s homoeroticism, the method travels: trans spectatorship can similarly attend to fleeting gestures, performance, and containment strategies rather than demanding explicit identity labels [[35]](https://mejduleneshomali.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mew152_01shomali_fpp.pdf). Her use of Muñoz’s **disidentification** is useful for analyzing how trans and gender-nonconforming viewers might inhabit films that partly constrain them [[35]](https://mejduleneshomali.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mew152_01shomali_fpp.pdf).

#### 4.4. Sexuality-in-Arab-cinema meta-theory: beyond allegory and auteurism
Ginsberg argues that sexuality theorization in Arab cinema has been minimal and calls for moving beyond limiting allegorical and auteurist approaches, while also navigating the intellectual terrain shaped by Massad debates and pinkwashing critiques [[33]](https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/jciaw_00120_1). For trans cinema, this supports a methodological commitment: avoid reducing trans figures to “the nation” or “the West vs Islam” allegory; instead, do medium-specific analysis of narrative, performance, editing, sound, and reception.

#### 4.5. Pinkwashing/homonationalism discourse as reception context (Israel/Palestine-related films)
Stelder’s analysis clarifies how pinkwashing debates can reframe Israeli violence into debates about Palestinian homophobia, and cautions that importing “homonationalism” as a primary analytic can sideline Palestinian grassroots queer critiques [[41]](https://feralfeminisms.com/the-limits-of-transnationalizing-homonationalism-in-for-palestine/). For films like *Her Name Was Zehava* and *The Belle from Gaza*, this is essential not as a template but as a reception-governance map: how will festivals, critics, and NGOs narrate the films’ politics? [[11]](https://newlinesmag.com/spotlight/her-name-was-zehava-points-a-uniquely-insightful-lens-on-the-human-cost-of-the-occupation/), [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Belle_from_Gaza), [[41]](https://feralfeminisms.com/the-limits-of-transnationalizing-homonationalism-in-for-palestine/).

## 5) In-depth film discussions (four sustained readings; at least three required)

### Film 1: *Be Like Others / Transsexual in Iran* (Tanaz Eshaghian, 2008) — documentary, clinic-centered legibility

**Why it matters in MENA trans cinema.** Few films have shaped global perception of “trans in the Middle East” as strongly as this Iran-focused documentary, with Sundance premiere and major festival circulation noted in the available record [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others). The film’s core structural decision—to anchor trans life around a **gender reassignment clinic**—makes it a paradigmatic text for analyzing **medicalization, filtering, and documentary sobriety**.

#### (a) The clinic as cinematic apparatus of recognition
The film follows patients at a Tehran gender reassignment clinic and frames Iran as a space where homosexual relationships are illegal while sex reassignment is permitted (linked in the film’s discourse to a Khomeini-era fatwa allowing operations for “diagnosed transsexuals”) [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others). Even without granular scene-by-scene transcript in this source set, the film’s described focus operationalizes Najmabadi’s point that legal/medical authorities construct sex change as cure and enforce a filtering regime that separates “trans” from “homosexual” [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf).

**Film-theoretical payoff:** the clinic is not only a location; it is a **documentary apparatus** that generates:
- authorized speech (doctors, diagnoses),
- visual evidence (pre/post bodily narratives),
- and narrative teleology (surgery as “resolution”).

This maps onto documentary theory’s emphasis on persuasive “voice”: the film’s voice is shaped by the institutions it records, even when it aims to critique them [[32]](https://journals.openedition.org/inmedia/1601).

#### (b) Gender/sexuality entanglement and disavowal
The film’s summary notes that patients assert they are not homosexual and describe homosexuality as shameful/immoral, while the filmmaker’s reported view is that shame can drive people toward transition because identifying as transsexual may allow less harassment than being read as homosexual [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others). This is precisely where trans media studies cautions against letting queer theory swallow trans analysis: the film’s world is organized by institutional distinctions and moral hierarchies between categories, not by a unified “LGBTQ” identity [[16]](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/images/61.2-infocus.pdf).

Najmabadi explicitly describes how international media increasingly circulated the claim that sex reassignment in Iran is coercively imposed on homosexuals, producing reductive discourses about Iran and Islam [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf). *Be Like Others* is therefore analytically double-edged:
- It can illuminate how categories constrain lives.
- But it can also be *received* as confirmation of civilizational “shock” (a pattern Shakerifar identifies as a Western media appetite) [[31]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/visual-representations-of-iranian-transgenders/6737035B543DF86A9619AC67AB4594E0).

#### (c) Narrative outcomes: precarious life after recognition
The available synopsis highlights divergent trajectories:
- Ali Askar, harassed for femininity, “does not want to become a woman but sees no other options,” transitions to Negar, is disowned, and works as a prostitute [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others).
- Anoosh becomes Anahita and is depicted as happy and engaged, though the fiancé becomes distant [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others).

**Trans theory lens:** This divergence is central to trans necropolitics: recognition (ID changes, surgery) does not guarantee livability; it can be followed by family expulsion, poverty, and sexual labor [[17]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-03-17_5c8eb05cad040_TransNecropoliticsSnorton.pdf). A trans-of-color critique would further ask how such images circulate globally—do they become “resources” that shore up moral panics or humanitarian spectatorship? [[17]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-03-17_5c8eb05cad040_TransNecropoliticsSnorton.pdf).

#### (d) What this film enables—and what it risks
- **Enables:** a view of trans life as institutionally produced (medical, clerical, familial), not merely personal; it shows how “options” are structured by law and stigma [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others), [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf).
- **Risks:** serving as globally consumed “evidence” of Islamic hypocrisy or barbarity—exactly the reductive totalizing discourse Najmabadi warns about [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf), and the “shock” framing Shakerifar identifies in Western reception [[31]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/visual-representations-of-iranian-transgenders/6737035B543DF86A9619AC67AB4594E0).

### Film 2: *Facing Mirrors* (Negar Azarbayjani, 2011/2012) — fiction feature, solidarity road narrative, classed recognition

**Why it matters.** *Facing Mirrors* is repeatedly framed as the **first Iranian narrative feature with a transgender protagonist** in LGBTQ festival discourse and distribution materials [[57]](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors), [[58]](https://www.thefilmcollaborative.org/films/facingmirrors). Its fiction form allows different questions than clinic documentaries: how does narrative cinema stage transness through genre, identification, melodrama, and encounter?

#### (a) Road structure and the ethics of “tolerance”
Variety characterizes the film as a “dual character study” in which Rana (a traditional working woman driving a cab under economic pressure) meets Adineh/Eddie (a wealthy “pre-op transsexual” fleeing an arranged marriage and planning surgery) and they develop solidarity “rather than moralistic notions of tolerance” [[56]](https://variety.com/2011/film/reviews/facing-mirrors-1117945989/). Frameline similarly foregrounds the encounter: Eddie flags down Rana’s taxi; disclosure produces panic and a crash; the remainder builds an unlikely bond as Eddie waits for documents for surgery abroad [[57]](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors).

**Film theory lens:** The road/vehicle space is a classic cinematic device for:
- forced proximity,
- shifting identification,
- and dialogue-driven transformation.
Here, the taxi becomes a **mobile moral theater**: Rana’s worldview is destabilized not by abstract debate but by co-presence, danger, and negotiated mutual aid.

#### (b) Transness as legibility crisis—and as narrative motor
The film’s plot is triggered when Rana realizes Eddie is transgender and planning an operation [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facing_Mirrors). This is “indexicality” dramatized: the story hinges on what must be known, shown, or confessed for a person to be socially located as man/woman [[16]](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/images/61.2-infocus.pdf). Unlike documentary “expert speech,” fiction externalizes these pressures through:
- pursuit and flight (from family),
- public risk (police, accidents),
- and the relational labor of explanation.

Najmabadi’s “filtering” framework remains relevant even in fiction: not because the taxi is a clinic, but because Eddie’s life is organized around proof, documents, and the management of category boundaries [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf).

#### (c) Class, gendered labor, and mutual recognition
Rana’s labor (driving a taxi clandestinely) and Eddie’s wealth/family control create an asymmetry that the film uses to reframe transness as part of a broader gender regime. The trans character is not simply “the issue”; the film is equally a story of how patriarchy organizes women’s and men’s mobility, work, and marriage. That aligns with Kheshti’s broader claim that Iranian cinema constructs spaces of trans/queer potential within an “aesthetics of resistance” shaped by censorship and national belonging struggles [[30]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-23_61c4e7e24d00f_Cross-DressingandGenderTrespassing-TheTransgenderMoveasaSiteofAgentialPotentialintheNewIranianCinema.pdf).

#### (d) Reception context: “taboo,” release, and festival framing
A Guardian report frames the Iranian theatrical release as bringing a “taboo subject” to the big screen, emphasizing Iran’s legal allowance of sex-change operations alongside severe penalties for homosexuality [[5]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/02/iranian-film-taboo-subject-transsexuals). Festival discourse positions the film as pioneering and emphasizes performance (Shayesteh Irani’s role) [[57]](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors). This reception field matters: Kheshti warns that films containing “transgender moves” can circulate in “first-world” gay and lesbian festivals and be framed as “about” Western-liberal LGBT identity in ways that flatten local meaning [[30]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-23_61c4e7e24d00f_Cross-DressingandGenderTrespassing-TheTransgenderMoveasaSiteofAgentialPotentialintheNewIranianCinema.pdf). Even where *Facing Mirrors* is explicitly about a trans man, the same mechanism of festival legibility can shape how transness is understood internationally (as rights parable, tolerance lesson, “Islamic exception,” etc.).

---

### Film 3: *The Great Safae* (Randa Maroufi, 2014) — experimental “fictional documentary,” domestic labor, testimony uncertainty, hchouma

**Why it matters.** *The Great Safae* expands what “trans cinema” can be in MENA-related work: not clinic-centered and not a linear transition narrative, but an **aesthetic investigation of memory, domestic labor, and the social illegibility of gender variance**.

#### (a) Ambiguity as method (not an evasion)
AFMI describes the film as a fictional, experimental documentary inspired by a real transgender woman who worked as a domestic servant for the director’s family; the family did not understand her “true” identity; the film reimagines Safae’s routine and depicts changing from male to female while weaving family conversation about gender norms [[7]](https://arabfilminstitute.org/queer-arab-films-to-watch-during-pride-month/). A catalog description intensifies this: the film deploys “real and fake witnesses,” “true and false memories,” and “various incarnations of Safae,” deliberately avoiding “the easy trap of exoticism” [[84]](https://www.randamaroufi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-franck-dumas-EN.pdf). Maroufi herself emphasizes a “porous border between documentary and fiction” and an approach between reportage, cinema, and sociological study; she explicitly links the film to the “transsexual housekeeper” and the cultural logic of *hchouma* (between shame and modesty) [[83]](https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/bigreview/article/view/20445/9194).

**Trans theory lens:** This is a concrete cinematic response to the limits of indexicality and recognition. Rather than proving Safae’s gender through biomedical evidence, the film asks: **what does a household know, and how?** That aligns with trans media studies’ insistence that traditional representation models can be insufficient for grasping trans subjectivities, and that we must examine how bodies become “somebody” to viewers (or remain “no-body”) within regimes of recognition [[16]](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/images/61.2-infocus.pdf).

#### (b) Domestic labor and the trans archive
The film’s anchor in domestic service is not incidental. It places gender variance within a classed labor hierarchy: a worker inside the home, seen but not fully known, present as function, absence, or rumor. Decolonial trans critique asks who benefits from trans stories and how institutions profit from trans lives; *The Great Safae* turns this question inward toward the bourgeois family’s memory and its incomplete witnessing [[20]](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1539790v).

#### (c) Film form: shimmering, mirage, and the aesthetics of change
Steinbock’s concept of “shimmering images” frames trans cinema as an “aesthetics of change,” where sex/gender can appear mirage-like, emergent, and affective rather than fixed [[25]](https://www.dukeupress.edu/shimmering-images). While *The Great Safae* is not analyzed shot-by-shot in the available excerpts, the described structure (multiple incarnations, unreliable testimony, staged reenactment) is exactly the kind of form that can produce “shimmering” effects—transition not as a singular surgical “moment,” but as a flicker between social readings, clothing, speech, and memory.

This also productively revisits Sandy Stone’s critique of trans narratives as morality tales/origin myths that locate “truth” in a single transformation moment (often surgery) [[24]](https://uberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trans-manifesto.pdf). *The Great Safae* refuses that teleology by making the “unsolved puzzle” itself the motor of spectatorship [[84]](https://www.randamaroufi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-franck-dumas-EN.pdf).

### Film 4: *Treat Me Like Your Mother* (Mohamad Abdouni, 2025) — Lebanese trans memory work as photographic documentary

**Why it matters.** This documentary explicitly positions itself as **archive-building**: “arguably the first photographic archive of trans women in Lebanon,” narrating experiences across four decades and linking personal images to community history and vanished safe spaces [[14]](https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/a6aa4102-ea72-4f6e-a7f0-21d17dcfd526/treat-me-like-your-mother/).

#### (a) Scrapbook form and documentary voice
IDFA describes the film as a photographic scrapbook weaving images from the women’s archives with home video from the director’s family vault, accompanied by the women’s voices [[14]](https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/a6aa4102-ea72-4f6e-a7f0-21d17dcfd526/treat-me-like-your-mother/). In documentary theory terms, this is a choice about “voice” and persuasion: rather than making the clinic the authoritative apparatus, the film privileges **self-archiving** and collective narration [[32]](https://journals.openedition.org/inmedia/1601), [[14]](https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/a6aa4102-ea72-4f6e-a7f0-21d17dcfd526/treat-me-like-your-mother/). It shifts the evidentiary regime from diagnosis to memory, friendship, and images kept despite war and precarity.

#### (b) Against necropolitical consumption: making life, not only injury, the archive
Trans necropolitics warns that trans suffering and death can become the primary resource through which trans people of color enter public discourse [[17]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-03-17_5c8eb05cad040_TransNecropoliticsSnorton.pdf). *Treat Me Like Your Mother* suggests a different strategy: archive as livability—trans motherhood as community care under adversity; remembrance of places like the Raouche strip as queer haven; and the survival of images as counter-history [[14]](https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/a6aa4102-ea72-4f6e-a7f0-21d17dcfd526/treat-me-like-your-mother/). Even when violence and loss are present (war, vanished safe spaces), the organizing form is not spectacle of injury but persistence of relational worlds.

## 6) Comparative through-lines across the corpus (what these films collectively teach)

### 6.1. Institutions of legibility vs archives of selfhood
- **Iran clinic-centered documentaries** (*Be Like Others*, *Inside Out*) foreground institutional legibility: clerics, psychiatrists, surgeons, permits [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others), [[81]](https://icarusfilms.com/if-insi). Najmabadi’s “filtering” explains why these scenes recur: the border work between “trans” and “homosexual” is an active governance project that also creates porous spaces navigated via self-narration [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf).  
- **Lebanese and Maghrebi memory/portrait films** (*Treat Me Like Your Mother*, *The Great Safae*) foreground self-archiving and household testimony rather than diagnosis, re-siting trans truth in images, rumor, and voice [[14]](https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/a6aa4102-ea72-4f6e-a7f0-21d17dcfd526/treat-me-like-your-mother/), [[7]](https://arabfilminstitute.org/queer-arab-films-to-watch-during-pride-month/), [[83]](https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/bigreview/article/view/20445/9194), [[84]](https://www.randamaroufi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-franck-dumas-EN.pdf).

### 6.2. The politics of visibility: when being seen increases danger
Visibility is not automatically emancipatory; it can increase risk and extract value [[16]](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/images/61.2-infocus.pdf). This is evident across:
- migration/escape plots in Iranian shorts (*My Endless Eclipse*) [[71]](https://shortfilmdepot.com/en/film/My_Endless_Eclipse),
- the West Bank/Tel Aviv vulnerability and carceral violence described in *Her Name Was Zehava* [[11]](https://newlinesmag.com/spotlight/her-name-was-zehava-points-a-uniquely-insightful-lens-on-the-human-cost-of-the-occupation/),
- and the precarious labor economies implied in *Cinema Al Fouad* (cabaret labor to fund surgery) [[74]](https://www.cinemapolitica.org/film/cinema-al-fouad/), [[82]](https://sinematranstopia.com/en/yearnings-and-unfulfilled-dreams-from-the-personal-to-the-political/cinema-fouad-soha).

A surveillance lens helps connect these: gender variance is policed as deception, and strategies of concealment/visibility are forced choices rather than liberatory performances [[19]](https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/view/3267).

### 6.3. Genre and form: why MENA trans cinema is often documentary—and why that’s changing
Documentary’s “sober” authority can be politically useful (evidence, testimony) but also risky (fixing trans life into pathology or civilizational spectacle) [[32]](https://journals.openedition.org/inmedia/1601), [[31]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/visual-representations-of-iranian-transgenders/6737035B543DF86A9619AC67AB4594E0). Meanwhile, fiction features like *Facing Mirrors* show how narrative cinema can stage transness relationally—through class, mobility, and solidarity—rather than as an explanatory case file [[56]](https://variety.com/2011/film/reviews/facing-mirrors-1117945989/), [[57]](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors). Experimental works like *The Great Safae* push further: they make legibility itself unstable, treating trans history as a problem of memory and testimony [[84]](https://www.randamaroufi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-franck-dumas-EN.pdf), [[83]](https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/bigreview/article/view/20445/9194).

### 6.4. Regional discourse traps: “pinkwashing,” “Gay International,” and the danger of flattening
Ginsberg warns that sexuality-in-Arab-cinema theory has been constrained by debates around Massad and pinkwashing, and calls for more substantive film analysis beyond allegory/auteurism [[33]](https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/jciaw_00120_1). Stelder further shows how pinkwashing discourse can redirect attention from settler-colonial violence into debates about Palestinian homophobia [[41]](https://feralfeminisms.com/the-limits-of-transnationalizing-homonationalism-in-for-palestine/). For trans films in Israel/Palestine contexts (*The Belle from Gaza*, *Her Name Was Zehava*), these frameworks are essential as **reception analysis tools**: how will festivals and media position trans subjects relative to state branding, security, and humanitarian narratives? [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Belle_from_Gaza), [[11]](https://newlinesmag.com/spotlight/her-name-was-zehava-points-a-uniquely-insightful-lens-on-the-human-cost-of-the-occupation/), [[41]](https://feralfeminisms.com/the-limits-of-transnationalizing-homonationalism-in-for-palestine/).

## 7) Practical close-reading prompts (a toolkit synthesized from the theories above)

To analyze additional films in the corpus (and to deepen readings beyond plot), the following prompts operationalize the cited trans theory + film theory:

1. **Legibility scenes:** Where does the film require proof (documents, bodies, surgery, expert testimony)? What counts as evidence, and who controls it? (Indexicality and recognition) [[16]](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/images/61.2-infocus.pdf), [[22]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-27_5d657dcb33942_182058882-Professing-Selves-by-Afsaneh-Najmabadi.pdf).  
2. **Documentary voice:** Who speaks with authority—subjects, doctors, clerics, narrators, family members? How does the film persuade? (Discourses of sobriety; documentary voice) [[32]](https://journals.openedition.org/inmedia/1601), [[81]](https://icarusfilms.com/if-insi).  
3. **Shimmer vs telos:** Does the film treat transition as emergent and affective (“shimmering”) or as a single event that resolves narrative? [[25]](https://www.dukeupress.edu/shimmering-images), [[24]](https://uberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trans-manifesto.pdf).  
4. **Extraction risk:** How might scenes of violence, sex work, or imprisonment be consumed internationally? Do they become necropolitical resources? [[17]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-03-17_5c8eb05cad040_TransNecropoliticsSnorton.pdf).  
5. **Transnational framing:** How do subtitles, festival positioning, and NGO/human-rights discourse shape what “trans” means here? (Concept travel; monolingualism critique) [[21]](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/download/15592/3196/48053), [[30]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-23_61c4e7e24d00f_Cross-DressingandGenderTrespassing-TheTransgenderMoveasaSiteofAgentialPotentialintheNewIranianCinema.pdf).  
6. **Decolonial accountability:** Who benefits materially and professionally from the film’s circulation? What does the film do to resist turning trans life into a consumable problem? [[20]](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1539790v).  
7. **Censorship-shaped form:** If direct depiction is risky, what narrative devices (passing/cross-dressing, road encounters, domestic testimony, archive montage) create spaces of agency? [[30]](https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-23_61c4e7e24d00f_Cross-DressingandGenderTrespassing-TheTransgenderMoveasaSiteofAgentialPotentialintheNewIranianCinema.pdf), [[14]](https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/a6aa4102-ea72-4f6e-a7f0-21d17dcfd526/treat-me-like-your-mother/).

## 8) Brief note on an adjacent comparator: *Joyland* (Pakistan, 2022)
Although Pakistan is not typically classified as MENA, *Joyland* is frequently programmed in “Middle East” festival circuits and is analytically valuable as a nearby comparator for how trans/feminine performance, erotic theater economies, and censorship moral panics operate in a Muslim-majority context. The available record documents its Cannes premiere and subsequent censorship controversies, including bans, edits, and provincial restrictions, and the film’s insistence that it is “not an issue-based film” but a critique of patriarchy, even as trans representation became the public flashpoint [[10]](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/joyland-saim-sadiq-interview-film-ban-intl), [[44]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/14/joyland-banned-in-pakistan-cannes), [[47]](https://time.com/6236467/joyland-pakistan-saim-sadiq-interview/), [[48]](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/24/saim-sadiq-joyland-interview-cannes-jury-prize-trans-drama), [[46]](https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/features/how-saim-sadiq-joyland-beat-censors-pakistan), [[51]](https://filmmakermagazine.com/120704-interview-saim-sadiq-joyland/). If used in a MENA-focused paper, it should be presented explicitly as a **regional neighbor comparator** rather than folded into MENA.

If you want, I can (1) expand this into a more formal academic article structure (abstract + literature review + methodology + conclusion), (2) add a dedicated section on Israel/Palestine trans cinema reception via pinkwashing discourse using *Her Name Was Zehava*/*The Belle from Gaza*, or (3) produce a teaching syllabus pairing each film with the most relevant theory readings from the cited set.
