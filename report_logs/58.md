QUESTION:
Exploring Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) in Plants and animals (ie Non-Microbial Systems)
You could examine instances of horizontal gene transfer in eukaryotes—particularly plants and animals—and evaluate the evolutionary significance of these transfers. Its very rare and therefore must have a really interesting reason behind this adaptation!
Especially as this horizontal gene transfer has been well -studied in microbial systems, but not in plants and animals (this is a relatively new discovery).  Understanding  how commonly genes move between eukaryotic species and whether these transfers confer benefits would be really interesting to find out

ANSWER:
### 1) Reality check: “very rare” overall, but *not* uniformly rare across eukaryotes (and it’s strongly context-dependent)

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) **does occur** in plants and animals, but:

- It is **much less frequent** (and far harder to inherit) than in microbes because multicellular eukaryotes add barriers: compartmentalized genomes, protected germlines (especially in animals), complex regulation, and incompatibilities in expression/targeting/protein interaction networks [[22]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9471246/), [[24]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0705), [[29]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pei3.70087).  
- Where it *is* convincingly documented, it is often **highly non-random**: concentrated in particular lineages (e.g., parasitic plants, some herbivorous insects, bdelloid rotifers, some nematodes) and enriched for genes that plausibly help in **ecological conflict** (host–parasite, plant–herbivore, pathogen defense) or **metabolic capability** [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113), [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/), [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/), [[56]](https://www3.botany.ubc.ca/keeling/PDF/24HGT.pdf), [[62]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3896011/).  
- A major shift since ~2015 is that the field has become far more conservative because multiple headline claims of massive animal HGT were later traced to **contamination/misassembly** (e.g., the tardigrade episode) [[14]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983848/), [[15]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1600338113), and because it’s now clear that **reference databases themselves contain contamination** at scale [[35]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7218494/), [[36]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10831095/). This has tightened “accepted case” lists, but strengthened the best examples.

So the interesting evolutionary question is less “Why did eukaryotes evolve HGT?” (they didn’t evolve it as a single adaptation) and more:

- **Under what ecological + cellular conditions do foreign genes reach heritable lineages?**
- **Which transferred genes are worth keeping (selection), and why those genes?**

The rest of this answer is organized around those questions.

---

## 2) Best-validated case studies in **plants** (what moved, between whom, what it does, how strong the evidence is)

Plant HGT comes in several “flavors,” with **plant–plant** HGT being especially strong in parasitic systems and in some grasses, and **organelle-associated HGT** (especially mitochondria) being unusually prominent.

### 2.1 Parasitic plants: repeated, genome-scale **nuclear** HGT with functional signatures

#### Orobanchaceae parasites (e.g., *Striga*, *Phelipanche*, *Triphysaria*): dozens of high-confidence nuclear HGTs
A landmark study used transcriptomes across parasitic Orobanchaceae of varying dependence and a nonparasitic relative, applying a phylogenetic screen followed by **extensive validation** to call **52 high-confidence HGT events** [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113). Key findings:

- **More HGT** in more dependent parasites (facultative → obligate hemiparasite → holoparasite) [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113).
- Many HGT genes show **haustorium-biased expression**, consistent with roles in the feeding interface [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113).
- Intron sequence evidence suggested transfer often involved **genomic DNA fragments**, not just processed mRNAs (important mechanistically) [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113).
- Most transferred genes evolve under **purifying selection**, indicating functional constraint; a smaller fraction showed signals consistent with adaptive change [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113).

**Evolutionary significance:** This is one of the strongest “HGT contributes to parasitism” datasets because it links (i) ecology (host contact), (ii) expression in the key organ, and (iii) selection signatures [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113).

#### *Cuscuta* (dodder): >100 transcribed, likely functional nuclear HGTs; convergence with Orobanchaceae
A separate high-impact analysis in *Cuscuta* reported **108 transcribed and probably functional HGT events** plus **42 additional host-derived regions** (TEs, pseudogenes, noncoding) [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/). Notable points:

- Many HGT genes are **highly expressed in haustoria** [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/).
- **18 gene families** were independently acquired via HGT in both *Cuscuta* and Orobanchaceae—convergent retention strongly suggesting repeated adaptive value in parasitic plants [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/).
- Genome evidence again supports **DNA-fragment transfer** rather than retroprocessed RNA alone [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/).
- Some HGT loci generate **24-nt small RNAs** (RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway), and one overlaps a microRNA implicated in regulating host gene expression—suggesting HGT can contribute to *regulatory* as well as coding functions at the host interface [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/).

**Evolutionary significance:** Beyond “extra enzymes,” this raises the possibility that parasites can acquire **host-like regulators or small-RNA-generating loci** that help manipulate hosts [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/).

---

### 2.2 Plant–plant HGT in **non-parasitic grasses**: dozens of nuclear genes, often in large fragments

A major update in the last decade is that **plant–plant nuclear HGT is not restricted to parasitism**.

#### *Alloteropsis semialata* (grass): many laterally acquired genes, in big chunks
A chromosome-scale study identified **57 additional nuclear LGTs** (beyond earlier known ones), involving **≥9 donors**, clustered into **23 acquired fragments up to 170 kb** [[9]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810031116). Many were **expressed** and inferred to contribute functions; LGTs were also detected in other grasses, suggesting broader prevalence [[9]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810031116).

**Why this is credible:** genome-scale phylogenomics + large fragments (hard to explain by simple annotation errors) + expression evidence [[9]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810031116).

#### Family-wide grass survey: LGT in most species examined, ecology correlates
A broader scan across 17 grass species reported LGT in **13/17 species**, with strong between-species variation and a notable correlate: **rhizomatous species acquired more genes**, interpreted as increased opportunity for transfers into meristem/germline-relevant tissues [[48]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17328). LGT frequency increased with **phylogenetic relatedness** (compatibility), yet transfers still occurred across deep divergence within Poaceae [[48]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17328).

**Evolutionary significance:** This supports a general principle: in plants, **“opportunity + compatibility”** may predict LGT success [[48]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17328).

---

### 2.3 Mitochondrial HGT in plants: sometimes extreme, sometimes “replacement” of core genes

Plant mitochondrial genomes are unusually permissive to foreign DNA compared with animal mitochondria (more recombination, large intergenic regions, dynamic structure), and many plant-to-plant HGT reports involve mitochondria [[4]](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43402), [[29]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pei3.70087).

#### *Lophophytum* (holoparasitic plant): functional mitochondrial gene space dominated by host-derived genes
One of the most striking cases: *Lophophytum mirabile*’s mitogenome contains **29 intact effectively single-copy mitochondrial protein genes**, of which **17 were acquired from legumes** (hosts) and several are chimeric due to recombination [[1]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16926). RNA-seq showed broad transcription across the mitogenome and statistically significant transcript levels for almost all intact genes; editing patterns were consistent with mitochondrial expression [[1]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16926).

A later study (2024) extended this with multiple individuals/species and proposed that foreign DNA can form **independent circular chromosomes** (“circle-mediated HGT”), reaching **~74% foreign DNA**, challenging the assumption that foreign mtDNA must integrate into an existing chromosome to persist [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044460/).

**Evolutionary significance:** This implies that in some parasitic plants, mitochondria can become a **mosaic of host-derived functional genes**, potentially because constant intimate contact and mitochondrial fusion/recombination dynamics allow repeated capture and retention [[1]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16926), [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044460/).

#### “Foreign mitochondrial plastid DNA” (MTPT) as evidence of frequent mt-to-mt transfer
A comparative study reported that **~1 in 5 angiosperms** surveyed contained at least one foreign MTPT fragment and argued that many cases likely reflect a **two-step process**: plastid→mitochondrion transfer within a donor species (IGT), followed by mitochondrion→mitochondrion interspecies transfer (HGT) [[4]](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43402). This supports a view that mitochondrial exchange between plants may be more common than traditionally thought, even outside the most extreme parasitic examples [[4]](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43402).

#### Multi-step chain transfer (“Pytheas”): IGT then two HGTs across three plant species
A 2025 study reported a plastid-derived sequence that moved **plastome → mitogenome within *Cuscuta*** (IGT), then **HGT to a Fabaceae host lineage mitogenome**, then **HGT to *Orobanche rigens*** mitogenome, with extensive sequence modification along the way [[3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-31853-x). The authors interpret this as robust evidence that host–parasite systems can act as **conduits connecting parasite-to-parasite gene flow** via shared hosts [[3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-31853-x).

---

### 2.4 Grafting as an experimentally demonstrated route for horizontal movement of whole organelles (plants)

A key reason plant HGT is “newly understood” is that mechanisms once dismissed are now experimentally supported.

A Science Advances study used reciprocal grafts in tobacco lines carrying compartment-specific selectable markers and fluorescent reporters and showed that **plastid genomes can transfer across graft junctions**, producing doubly resistant tissue and regenerated plants where both reporters co-occurred in the same cells [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7775762/). Imaging suggested a mechanism: during wound-induced callus proliferation, plastids dedifferentiate into **motile amoeboid organelles** and can pass through newly formed **cell wall pores** into adjacent cells [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7775762/).

**Evolutionary significance:** This provides a concrete, non-parasitic mechanism for **organelle capture** and horizontal genome transfer, potentially explaining some “organelle capture” patterns in plant evolution [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7775762/).

---

### 2.5 Cautionary plant example: “accepted cases” can shrink after reanalysis (divergence ≠ HGT or gene loss)

A reanalysis of mistletoe (*Viscum*) mitogenomes showed earlier claims of extreme gene loss and missing rRNA genes were **incorrect**, attributed to annotation/BLAST issues under extreme sequence divergence [[8]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12870-017-0992-8). This case matters because it illustrates a broader theme: **plant mitochondrial genes can evolve very fast**, and without careful methods, divergence can be mistaken for absence or foreign origin [[8]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12870-017-0992-8).

---

## 3) Best-validated case studies in **animals** (metazoans)

Animal HGT is constrained by germline segregation, but it is not nonexistent. The best-supported cases tend to involve (i) **ecological intimacy** with donors (symbionts, parasites, diet), (ii) genes that provide a **clear niche advantage**, and (iii) robust anti-contamination validation.

### 3.1 Herbivorous insects: direct **plant-to-insect** gene transfer with functional payoff

#### Whitefly (*Bemisia tabaci*): plant detoxification genes acquired and used
A 2022 genome-wide study reported **49 plant-like genes** from at least **24 independent HGT events**, present as orthologs across multiple cryptic *Bemisia* species, **expressed**, and under **purifying selection** [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/). Reported functions are enriched for plant–insect interaction biology [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/).

Crucially, earlier functional work (summarized in this paper) showed a specific transferred gene, **BtPMaT1** (a plant-like BAHD acyltransferase), detoxifies plant phenolic glucosides; silencing it via transgenic host plants increased whitefly mortality and reduced fecundity [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/). That is unusually strong evidence linking HGT to **fitness and host breadth**.

**Evolutionary significance:** This suggests HGT can contribute to the evolution of extreme generalism in herbivores by importing ready-made plant biochemical tricks [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/).

---

### 3.2 Bdelloid rotifers: elevated HGT and evidence of functional deployment in biotic conflict

Bdelloid rotifers are often discussed because they appear to have unusually high fractions of foreign genes (though “how high” depends on method and definition) and unusual life history [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1), [[50]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4632278/), [[56]](https://www3.botany.ubc.ca/keeling/PDF/24HGT.pdf).

A 2024 study found that when challenged with a fungal pathogen, **horizontally acquired genes were >2× as likely to be upregulated** as other genes, and the most enriched upregulated loci were **bacterial-like PKS/NRPS clusters** (antibiotic biosynthesis-like), with much stronger induction in a pathogen-resistant species than a susceptible one [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1). This supports the idea that bdelloids have domesticated non-metazoan biosynthetic pathways to combat pathogens—rare among animals [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1).

**Evolutionary significance:** This is one of the best recent examples connecting animal HGT to an ecologically plausible “arms race” phenotype: pathogen resistance via antimicrobial secondary metabolism [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1).

**Important nuance:** Bdelloid studies have also faced controversy over some claims of within/between-species DNA exchange being artifacts of contamination; one critique showed apparent exchanges could be explained by sample cross-contamination in Sanger chromatograms [[53]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982218307061). This doesn’t negate interkingdom gene acquisitions in bdelloid genomes, but it reinforces that extraordinary claims require extraordinary QC [[53]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982218307061).

---

### 3.3 Insect immune defense: bacterial gene domestication retained across a major radiation

Ladybird beetles (Coccinellinae) were found to possess bacterially derived **cell wall hydrolase (cwh)** genes, rare in eukaryotes but maintained across tested species [[58]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00945-7). Functional evidence includes:

- Upregulation after infection with *Bacillus subtilis* [[58]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00945-7)  
- Recombinant protein suppresses bacterial proliferation [[58]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00945-7)  
- RNAi knockdown affects other antibacterial genes, indicating integration into immune networks [[58]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00945-7)

**Evolutionary significance:** Suggests HGT can become embedded in immune regulation and may support ecological success (the “radiation” link is plausible but harder to prove causally) [[58]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00945-7).

---

### 3.4 Parasites and parasite–host systems as HGT “delivery platforms” (mechanism-forward animal evidence)

#### Bracoviruses (parasitoid wasps): frequent chromosomal integration in hosts (mostly somatic), plus accidental germline integrations
Bracoviruses are domesticated viral systems in parasitoid wasps. A 2021 study characterized massive numbers of chromosomal integrations (12–85 per host haploid genome) of bracovirus circles into parasitized host tissues mediated by a conserved motif (HIM) [[18]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8549517/). It also reports that HIM-mediated integration has occurred accidentally into the wasp germline multiple times during evolution [[18]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8549517/).

**Evolutionary significance:** This provides a plausible, experimentally grounded mechanism by which DNA circles packaged by a symbiotic virus could occasionally become heritable in a host lineage—one of the clearest mechanistic routes for animal HGT, even if most documented integrations are somatic [[18]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8549517/).

---

### 3.5 Transposable element horizontal transfer (HTT): common relative to “ordinary gene” HGT, including in vertebrates

A 2020 study screening **307 vertebrate genomes** inferred **≥975 independent HTT events** across vertebrates diverged by >120 My, with **~93.7% involving ray-finned fishes** and <3% involving mammals and birds [[19]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15149-4). This highlights extreme heterogeneity and that **TEs move horizontally far more often than regular genes** [[19]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15149-4).

A separate 2022 study on BovB retrotransposons inferred **≥54 HT events**, with a striking predator→prey transfer pattern (snakes→frogs), and used multiple validation methods including FISH to rule out contamination and confirm chromosomal presence [[55]](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/39/4/msac052/43375294/msac052.pdf).

**Evolutionary significance:** Even when protein-coding gene HGT is rare in vertebrates, HTT supplies a route for horizontally introduced sequence that can later be co-opted (regulatory innovations, genome restructuring), though specific phenotypes are not always easy to link [[19]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15149-4), [[55]](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/39/4/msac052/43375294/msac052.pdf).

---

### 3.6 The “tardigrade lesson”: accepted animal HGT cases have become stricter

The famous tardigrade (*Hypsibius dujardini*) genome claim of ~17% HGT was largely refuted by a re-sequencing/reassembly study showing the signal was primarily contamination; strong candidates dropped to ~0.4% (0.2% bacterial + 0.2% non-metazoan eukaryote), with an upper bound estimate of 1–2% [[14]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983848/), [[15]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1600338113). This episode reshaped the field by making contamination-aware workflows non-negotiable [[15]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1600338113), [[34]](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1287/pdf), [[35]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7218494/), [[36]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10831095/).

## 4) Mechanisms: *how* can HGT happen in plants and animals, and which mechanisms have the best support?

It helps to separate two steps:

1) **Delivery** of foreign nucleic acid (DNA/RNA/organelles) into recipient cells  
2) **Heritable retention**, usually requiring stable integration or stable inheritance of an organelle/episome, plus expression compatibility [[22]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9471246/), [[24]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0705), [[29]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pei3.70087)

### 4.1 Mechanisms with strong direct evidence in plants

#### A) Haustorial bridges in parasitic plants (best-supported ecological conduit)
Parasitic plant haustoria form intimate connections (often vascular) that permit movement of macromolecules including RNAs; this creates a plausible substrate and route for HGT, consistent with large numbers of nuclear HGTs and strong haustorium expression biases in *Striga* relatives and *Cuscuta* [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113), [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/), [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12448838/).

#### B) Grafting / wound callus: organelle movement cell-to-cell (direct experiment)
Whole plastids (and thus plastid genomes) can cross graft junctions, with a proposed cellular mechanism involving motile, dedifferentiated plastids and new cell wall pores in callus [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7775762/). This is among the most mechanistically satisfying demonstrations because it is **observed and selectable**.

#### C) Mitochondrial receptiveness and recombination
Plant mitochondria accept foreign DNA more readily than plastids, consistent with frequent mt-to-mt HGT signals and large foreign tracts in some parasitic plants [[1]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16926), [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044460/), [[4]](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43402), [[29]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pei3.70087).

#### D) Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) and TE-rich transfer propensity (plausible, not fully proven)
A substantial fraction of plant horizontal transfers involve TEs, especially LTR retrotransposons, which naturally form circular intermediates; eccDNA has been proposed as a mobile substrate that could facilitate transfer and integration [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12448838/). This is mechanistically plausible but still more inferential than grafting or haustorium-based evidence.

#### E) Vectors: bacteria and viruses (strong for delivery; variable for adaptive domestication)
- **Agrobacterium** is a proven natural genetic engineer (T-DNA integration into plant nuclear genomes) [[29]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pei3.70087), [[31]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923250815001308). Sweet potato is a well-validated “naturally transgenic” crop with expressed Agrobacterium-derived T-DNAs [[61]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4426443/).  
- Viral integrations are widespread in plants (endogenous viral elements), showing delivery and integration can occur; functional domestication varies by case [[29]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pei3.70087).

---

### 4.2 Mechanisms with strong direct evidence (or strong mechanistic plausibility) in animals

#### A) Germline access is the key bottleneck (Weismann barrier)
Animals usually segregate germlines, so the rare events that matter must cross into germ cells or their precursors [[24]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0705), [[25]](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rspb/article/286/1909/20191263/85226/The-active-role-of-spermatozoa-in), [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983863/).

#### B) Viral/virus-like vectors (especially where integration is part of the life cycle)
- Parasitoid wasp bracovirus circles integrate frequently into host chromosomes in somatic tissues and have documented accidental germline integrations in wasps—supporting a credible route for wasp↔host sequence transfer over evolution [[18]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8549517/).  
- A 2023 study argues that **Mavericks/Polintons** (virus-like transposons encoding capsid and integrase-like proteins) act as cross-species HGT vectors in nematodes, transferring cargo genes between species separated by hundreds of millions of years [[24]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0705). This is one of the strongest modern proposals for a generalizable metazoan HGT vector because it couples mobility + packaging + integration machinery [[24]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0705).

#### C) Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and sperm uptake: evidence for soma→germline nucleic acid traffic
A 2019 review summarizes evidence that mammalian somatic EVs can deliver RNAs to epididymal sperm, crossing the Weismann barrier (for RNA-based inheritance), and that sperm across animals can bind/internalize exogenous nucleic acids [[25]](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rspb/article/286/1909/20191263/85226/The-active-role-of-spermatozoa-in). A separate report describes spontaneous uptake and nuclear internalization of foreign DNA in mouse sperm and evidence consistent with integration-like events, though some mechanistic claims (retrotranscription) were labeled preliminary [[32]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10213310/).

**Interpretation:** This does not prove natural adaptive gene HGT is common in mammals, but it does show that a hard barrier (soma→germline communication) is not absolute at the level of nucleic acid trafficking [[25]](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rspb/article/286/1909/20191263/85226/The-active-role-of-spermatozoa-in), [[32]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10213310/).

#### D) Transposable elements as frequent horizontal travelers
Genome-wide vertebrate analyses show HTT is abundant relative to gene HGT [[19]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15149-4), and BovB studies provide validated, geography-structured HT examples [[55]](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/39/4/msac052/43375294/msac052.pdf). TEs are pre-adapted to move and integrate, so they are the most common “horizontal sequences” in animals [[19]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15149-4).

## 5) Detection & validation in 2026: how researchers avoid fooling themselves

Because eukaryotic HGT is rare relative to contamination and gene-tree noise, modern best practice is **multi-layer validation**.

### 5.1 The core failure mode: contamination (in your sample, your assembly, *and the databases*)
- The tardigrade case shows that failure to remove contaminants pre-assembly can inflate HGT estimates enormously [[14]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983848/), [[15]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1600338113).  
- Tools like BlobTools/BlobToolKit emphasize GC-content + read coverage + taxonomic assignment to identify cobionts/contaminants and partition contigs/reads for reassembly [[34]](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1287/pdf), [[38]](https://github.com/genomehubs/blobtoolkit), [[39]](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org/blobtools2/).  
- Conterminator and ContScout show that public databases contain contamination at scale and that contaminated references can mislead similarity searches and phylogenies, directly generating false HGT claims [[35]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7218494/), [[36]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10831095/).

**Bottom line:** modern HGT studies must include explicit contamination screening of both the target genome and the reference data ecosystem.

### 5.2 Typical “best-practice” evidence stack for claiming HGT in plants/animals

Stronger claims combine most of the following:

1) **Initial candidate discovery** via similarity/taxonomy screens (e.g., Alien Index-type methods) [[42]](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/8/10/248), [[41]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10025432/)  
2) **Phylogenetic confirmation** with careful taxon sampling and artifact-aware tree building (tools like AvP or HGTphyloDetect automate parts of this) [[40]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9678320/), [[41]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10025432/)  
3) **Genomic integration evidence**  
   - The candidate is embedded within host scaffolds/contigs with consistent read depth  
   - Neighboring genes look host-like (not microbial-like clusters) [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983863/), [[40]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9678320/), [[36]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10831095/)  
4) **Presence across individuals / related species** (“phylogenetic perdurance”) [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983863/), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/)  
5) **Eukaryotic gene features / amelioration**  
   - introns (where expected), codon usage shifts, host regulatory compatibility [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983863/)  
6) **Expression evidence** (RNA-seq) and ideally condition-specific regulation relevant to phenotype [[33]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983863/), [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/)  
7) **Selection evidence** (purifying selection suggests constraint; occasional adaptive signals can support innovation) [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/), [[19]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15149-4)  
8) **Functional assays** (gold standard when feasible): enzyme activity, RNAi/knockdown, fitness effects, pathogen challenge [[58]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00945-7), [[59]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421001641), [[60]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/02365), [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1)

### 5.3 Ruling out “phylogenetic illusions”: gene loss, paralogy, model error
Even with clean data, gene trees can disagree with species trees for reasons other than HGT. Reviews of phylogenomic incongruence emphasize the roles of model misspecification, long-branch attraction, hidden paralogs, trimming artifacts, and insufficient sampling—any of which can mimic HGT-like topology [[45]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11499941/). This is one reason some interkingdom HGT claims in plants have been downgraded upon reanalysis with expanded sampling [[49]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12711439/).

### 5.4 A major recent reassessment: many “interkingdom plant HGT” claims do not survive updated phylogenomics
A 2025 reassessment of published interkingdom HGT claims in plants reconstructed trees with updated databases and concluded only **29.3%** of previously reported cases still supported an interkingdom HGT scenario; many were better explained by sampling gaps, gene loss, contamination, or annotation error [[49]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12711439/). This doesn’t refute plant HGT broadly (plant–plant and organellar HGT remain strong), but it shows that **cross-kingdom nuclear gene HGT into plants** is often over-claimed unless standards are very strict [[49]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12711439/).

---

## 6) How common is HGT in plants and animals? What “rate” even means depends on what you count.

### 6.1 Plants
- **Parasitic plants:** nuclear HGT on the order of **0.1–0.2% of genes** in some obligate parasites has been estimated (reviewed), with occasional transfer of very large genomic regions >100 kb [[47]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401529/). Individual studies can report dozens to >100 functional HGT loci in some parasitic genomes/transcriptomes [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113), [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/).  
- **Grasses:** multiple studies support that nuclear LGT is **widespread across Poaceae**, detected in most sampled species in family-level screens [[48]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17328). Species differ widely; rhizomatous growth correlates with higher LGT [[48]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17328).  
- **Mitochondria:** plant mitochondria show frequent evidence of foreign sequence acquisition and exchange (including MTPT-based evidence), and in some parasitic plants foreign mtDNA can dominate the genome [[1]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16926), [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044460/), [[4]](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43402).

### 6.2 Animals
- **Most animals:** functional gene HGT appears to be **low**; sweeping claims of massive HGT have often been reduced after contamination control (tardigrades) [[14]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983848/), [[15]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1600338113).  
- **Specific lineages:** some clades show strong signals and functional integration (whiteflies, bdelloids, some nematodes, some insect groups) [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/), [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1), [[62]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3896011/).  
- **Vertebrates:** ordinary gene HGT is not well supported as common in these sources; what is clearly widespread is **HTT** (transposable element transfer), with hundreds to thousands of events inferred across vertebrates and strong clade bias toward fishes [[19]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15149-4), [[55]](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/39/4/msac052/43375294/msac052.pdf).

---

## 7) Evolutionary significance: when HGT matters, it often matters *a lot* (but in narrow, gene-class-biased ways)

A consistent cross-eukaryote pattern is that retained HGTs disproportionately belong to gene classes that are:

- **Modular** and can function relatively independently  
- **Immediately beneficial** in a specific niche  
- Often related to **chemical warfare / detox / digestion / defense / parasitism**

### 7.1 Strong plant examples of adaptive significance
- Parasitic plants: HGT genes preferentially expressed in haustoria and under purifying selection—consistent with functional contributions to host exploitation [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113), [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/).  
- Grasses: laterally acquired genes include functions linked to photosynthesis and stress responses (e.g., in *Alloteropsis*) and are often expressed [[9]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810031116), [[48]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17328).  
- Sweet potato: Agrobacterium T-DNAs are integrated and expressed; fixation of one T-DNA region in cultivated accessions suggests (though does not prove mechanistically) selection during domestication [[61]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4426443/).

### 7.2 Strong animal examples of adaptive significance
- Whitefly: plant-derived detoxification gene BtPMaT1 has direct functional validation and affects survival and fecundity under silencing [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/).  
- Rotifers: horizontally acquired genes are disproportionately induced by pathogen challenge, with PKS/NRPS-like clusters suggesting antibiotic-like defense [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1).  
- Ladybird beetles: bacterial cwh genes contribute to antibacterial defense and are inducible and functional in assays [[58]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00945-7).  
- Herbivorous arthropods: bacterial-origin cyanide detoxification enzyme co-opted in mites and Lepidoptera, with recombinant enzyme evidence and phylogenetic distribution supporting ancient acquisition and functional specialization [[60]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/02365).  
- Plant-parasitic nematodes (reviewed evidence): HGT-derived plant cell wall–degrading enzymes are expressed/secreted; knockdowns reduce infection success, strongly supporting adaptive value in parasitism [[62]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3896011/).

### 7.3 A crucial counterpoint: “opportunity” doesn’t guarantee adaptive retention
Endosymbiont-to-host transfers (e.g., Wolbachia fragments in insect genomes) can be large but often pseudogenized/lowly expressed, resembling genomic litter rather than innovation [[62]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3896011/). So the interesting evolutionary story is not merely *transfer*, but **filtering by selection and compatibility**.

---

## 8) So why is eukaryotic HGT rare, and why do the retained cases look so “purposeful”?

### 8.1 The rarity comes from compounded barriers
To become an evolutionary factor, a transferred gene must pass multiple unlikely steps:

1) Escape donor, survive transit  
2) Enter recipient cells  
3) Reach a lineage that contributes to offspring (plants: meristems/gametes; animals: germline)  
4) Integrate or persist  
5) Be expressed properly (promoters/splicing/targeting)  
6) Avoid deleterious network effects  
7) Provide enough benefit (or at least not enough cost) to persist and spread

Regulatory and mechanistic discussions emphasize that each extra step sharply reduces overall probability, explaining why eukaryotic HGT is episodic rather than continuous [[22]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9471246/), [[24]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0705).

### 8.2 The “interesting reason” behind many retained HGTs is ecological conflict + modularity
When HGT *is* retained, it often provides an “off-the-shelf” biochemical capability in a conflict zone:

- **Parasite ↔ host** (haustorium; nematode effectors; detox; host manipulation) [[5]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608765113), [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/), [[62]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3896011/)  
- **Herbivore ↔ plant** (detoxification of plant defenses; digestion of plant polymers; cyanide detox) [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/), [[60]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/02365), [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4943190/)  
- **Predator/pathogen defense** (ladybird antibacterial genes; rotifer antibiotic-like clusters) [[58]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00945-7), [[13]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49919-1)

These functions are often more modular than core developmental genes, so they are less likely to break the organism when inserted, and more likely to generate a clear benefit.

### 8.3 “Opportunity + compatibility” explains many plant patterns
The grass results explicitly support a two-factor framing:

- **Opportunity**: physical/ecological scenarios enabling DNA to reach heritable tissue (rhizomes, close contact)  
- **Compatibility**: phylogenetic proximity increases chances that regulatory context, codon bias, protein interactions, and targeting signals are workable [[48]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17328)

Parasitic plants increase opportunity drastically through haustorial contact; grasses may increase opportunity through growth form and reproductive biology (e.g., pollination hypotheses discussed in reviews) [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12448838/), [[48]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17328).

### 8.4 Why mitochondria in plants are a hotspot
Plant mitochondrial genomes’ structural dynamics (recombination, large intergenic regions, frequent rearrangements) plausibly make them unusually receptive “landing pads” for foreign sequence, consistent with extensive mtDNA HGT and even replacement of core genes in extreme cases [[1]](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16926), [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044460/), [[4]](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43402), [[29]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pei3.70087).

---

## 9) Research gaps and testable predictions for 2026+ (what would most advance the field)

### 9.1 Move from “retrospective detection” to *observing HGT in action*
Plants now have an experimentally supported mechanism for organelle genome transfer at graft junctions [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7775762/). A next step is to test:

- How often transferred organelles (or fragments) reach **meristems** and become heritable
- Whether certain stressors (wounding, pathogens) increase transfer frequency
- Whether nuclear DNA can be co-transferred with organelles in realistic ecological grafting/natural inosculation settings

### 9.2 Mechanistic dissection of parasite interfaces
Parasitic plant HGT is well described genomically, but key unknowns remain:

- What physical form moves most often (naked DNA, organelles, vesicles, eccDNA, nuclei fragments)?
- What host/parasite repair pathways mediate integration?
- Are small-RNA-producing HGT loci disproportionately retained because they help **silence host genes**? (*Cuscuta* provides tantalizing hints) [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332314/).

### 9.3 Better quantification that separates: genes vs TEs vs organelles
Because TE HTT is common (even in vertebrates) while ordinary gene HGT is rarer, future “how common is HGT?” work should report separate metrics:

- **Event counts** vs **fraction of genes** vs **fraction of genome length**
- **Protein-coding genes** vs **TEs** vs **organelle capture**

The vertebrate TE work shows how misleading a single number can be across clades [[19]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15149-4).

### 9.4 Harder, but crucial: functional validation at scale
The most convincing adaptive HGT stories include direct functional assays (whitefly detox gene; ladybird immune gene; cyanide detox enzyme) [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599486/), [[58]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00945-7), [[60]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/02365). The field needs more:

- CRISPR/RNAi tests in non-model taxa
- Fitness assays under realistic ecological conditions (host plants, pathogens, toxins)
- Network-level analysis: how quickly do HGT genes become integrated into regulation?

### 9.5 Continued tightening of standards (and cleaning databases)
Given how often contamination has distorted HGT inference, progress depends on:

- Routine BlobToolKit-like assembly QC [[38]](https://github.com/genomehubs/blobtoolkit), [[39]](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org/blobtools2/)  
- Database contamination screening (Conterminator) [[35]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7218494/)  
- Tools explicitly distinguishing contamination from HGT (ContScout) [[36]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10831095/)  
- Phylogenetic workflows that address model error/paralogy/long-branch artifacts [[45]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11499941/)

---

## 10) Direct answer to your “it must have a really interesting reason behind this adaptation!” intuition

The strongest evidence supports a nuanced answer:

- **HGT is not a single adaptation** that plants/animals evolved; it’s a rare consequence of biological contact, vectors, and DNA repair/integration processes.  
- The **retained** HGTs look “interesting” because selection is a ruthless filter: only transfers that are (a) compatible and (b) beneficial (or at least not harmful) persist long enough to be detected.
- The “interesting reasons” are therefore usually ecological:
  - **conflict** (detoxification, immunity, parasitism)
  - **niche transitions** (new diets, host shifts, stress environments)
  - **mechanistic opportunity windows** (haustoria, graft wounds/callus, virus-like transposons, symbiont proximity to germline)

And the reason the field feels “new” in plants/animals is partly because genomics finally made these rare events detectable—but also because the community learned, painfully, that without rigorous QC, what looks like dramatic HGT can simply be contamination [[14]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4983848/), [[15]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1600338113), [[34]](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1287/pdf), [[35]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7218494/), [[36]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10831095/).

If you want, I can also (1) tabulate the strongest plant and animal cases side-by-side (donor → recipient → gene/function → evidence types), and/or (2) sketch a “decision tree” for evaluating whether a new putative eukaryotic HGT claim is likely real.
