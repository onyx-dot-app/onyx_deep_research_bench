ANSWER:
## 1) What “cloud-based train control” means in urban rail (2023–2026)

In metro/light-rail practice, “cloud-based train control” rarely means “put the vital CBTC safety loop on a public hyperscaler and run it over the open internet.” In the 2023–2026 material, it most often means **virtualized / software-defined train-control functions running on COTS compute in a centralized, cloud-like data center** (often on the operator’s premises), with **geo-redundancy**, **standard IP networking**, and **open interfaces/APIs**—i.e., a **private cloud / OT cloud** for signaling.

### A. Cloud as a *signaling data center* running CBTC functions on COTS
Siemens explicitly frames this model for urban CBTC:

- **Train2Cloud (CBTC)**: proprietary signaling hardware is replaced with **off‑the‑shelf servers** in an **on‑customer‑premise “signaling data center”** [[3]](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/global/en/portfolio/digital-solutions-software/infrastructure/signaling-x/train2cloud.html). Siemens states safety-critical CBTC applications (e.g., **ATP and interlocking**) run on those servers with its **DS3** safety platform, while non-safe applications like **ATS** can run on the same server hardware [[3]](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/global/en/portfolio/digital-solutions-software/infrastructure/signaling-x/train2cloud.html).  
- **Signaling X**: Siemens describes a centralized, “cloud-ready” platform integrating interlockings, signaling, and control systems into a **centralized, virtualized data center** [[5]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/world-premiere-siemens-proves-unique-signaling-x-solution-live-metro-operation), with an explicit **private cloud** live metro demonstration at the Singapore Rail Test Centre [[5]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/world-premiere-siemens-proves-unique-signaling-x-solution-live-metro-operation).

This is the clearest “cloud-based CBTC” definition in the sources: **cloud-like = virtualized compute + standardized hardware + centralized/geo-redundant data center**, not necessarily public cloud.

### B. Cloud as an OT cloud hosting “mission-critical rail applications”
Nokia uses the term **OT cloud** for a cloud environment dedicated to mission-critical rail applications and explicitly states that components like **RBCs, interlocking and SCADA** are being designed to run in **virtual machines or containers—typically in the OT cloud** [[34]](https://www.nokia.com/blog/railways-harness-greater-potential-in-the-cloud/). It emphasizes that the data-center network (“fabric”) becomes part of the mission-critical domain because it carries life-critical signaling/control traffic [[34]](https://www.nokia.com/blog/railways-harness-greater-potential-in-the-cloud/).

### C. Cloud as an *edge/cloud split*: keep field I/O local, move logic to cloud
A representative “edge/cloud split” description appears in T‑Systems’ account of cloud-based digital interlockings: keep what must stay near the field (“switches, barriers, signals”) local, but **move the control/business logic to a cloud** (“We are moving the actual control to our T Cloud”) [[35]](https://www.t-systems.com/de/en/insights/newsroom/expert-blogs/digital-interlockings-from-the-cloud-1087146). This is a canonical partitioning pattern for safety-related infrastructure modernization: **local edge for deterministic I/O + centralized compute for logic and supervision** [[35]](https://www.t-systems.com/de/en/insights/newsroom/expert-blogs/digital-interlockings-from-the-cloud-1087146).

### D. Cloud as “digital services around train control” (analytics, maintenance, ops apps)
Some widely deployed “cloud” functions sit adjacent to CBTC rather than replacing it:

- **Alstom HealthHub** is explicitly described as a **cloud-based** solution that monitors rolling stock, track, catenary and **signalling** assets, applying analytics for predictive maintenance [[7]](https://www.alstom.com/stories/future-services-digital-healthhub). It is positioned to reduce downtime (Alstom claims “up to 30% reduction in downtime”) [[7]](https://www.alstom.com/stories/future-services-digital-healthhub).  
- Alstom also describes a broad **Azure-based SaaS digital services platform** centralizing applications and data, using cloud components like **AKS (Kubernetes), API management, identity, and SIEM (Sentinel)** [[38]](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1674017054678739411-alstom-discrete-manufacturing-azure-en-france). This is “rail cloud,” but not explicitly “CBTC-in-cloud.”

### E. Cloud vs. train-centric architectures (important nuance)
Not all “next-gen” CBTC evolution implies centralization into a cloud. Alstom’s **Urbalis Fluence** is described as merging interlocking functions into a **train-centric architecture**, including “routing and interlocking functions that are built into the train,” and it highlights use of LTE/public networks and future 5G with “cybersecure resilience” [[36]](https://www.alstom.com/solutions/signalling/urban-signalling/urbalis-fluence-train-centric-cbtc). This shows two modernization vectors can coexist:

- **Centralized cloud-like compute** (signaling data center)
- **Distributed / train-centric functional relocation** (push intelligence onboard)

Both can still use cloud for supervision/analytics, but they change where the “center of gravity” sits.

## 2) Recent developments (2023–2026): deployments, pilots, and announcements

### 2.1 Siemens: CBTC functions demonstrated in a private cloud (2025) + “Train2Cloud” evolution (2023–2025)
**Live metro demonstration (Singapore Rail Test Centre, 2025)**  
Siemens claims a “world’s first live demonstration of metro operations with Signaling X,” explicitly stating **CBTC functions operated in a private cloud** at SRTC [[5]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/world-premiere-siemens-proves-unique-signaling-x-solution-live-metro-operation). Siemens says CBTC and interlocking software ran on standard IT hardware in a **Signaling Data Center**, with DS3 enabling safety-critical functions on COTS [[5]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/world-premiere-siemens-proves-unique-signaling-x-solution-live-metro-operation).

**Reported outcomes (Siemens claims)**  
From the same Signaling X/SRTC framing, Siemens claims:
- **Up to 20% higher operational efficiency**
- **Up to 30% energy savings** [[5]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/world-premiere-siemens-proves-unique-signaling-x-solution-live-metro-operation)

**Train2Cloud positioning (2023–2025)**  
Siemens presented “CBTC through the cloud” (Train2Cloud) as optimizing performance and lifecycle cost and enabling seamless geo-redundancy of a computing center [[1]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/2023-uitp-siemens-mobility-present-innovative-developments-urban-rail-mobility). In 2025 Siemens again described Train2Cloud as a wayside-oriented, cloud-based approach built on Trainguard MT and claimed “headways up to 80 seconds” as part of its benefit statements [[4]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-mobility-showcases-digital-solutions-urban-rail-transport-uitp-summit-2025).

**Signaling X (InnoTrans 2024 → onward)**  
Siemens describes Signaling X as a cloud platform integrating mainline and urban signaling into a centralized data center with geo-redundancy and standardized APIs, able to run safety-critical apps in a cyber-secure cloud environment using DS3 [[29]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-mobility-presents-signaling-x-and-next-level-rail-services-innotrans-2024). (These are Siemens statements; the sources do not provide independent validation.)

### 2.2 Hitachi Rail: CBTC + 5G train-to-ground becomes a key modernization vector (2024–2026)
**CBTC over 5G (New York + Hong Kong, 2024)**  
Hitachi Rail announced integration of **CBTC with 5G communications** for:
- **New York’s Crosstown Line** (private 5G network)
- **Hong Kong International Airport Automatic People Mover** (5G overlay onto existing SelTrac) [[20]](https://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2024/09/240919a.html)

Hitachi positions 5G as reducing limitations of legacy radio/Wi‑Fi, potentially reducing trackside radio access points relative to Wi‑Fi, and enabling higher bandwidth for real-time data reporting for maintenance/operations [[20]](https://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2024/09/240919a.html). (The release is communications-centric; it does not explicitly say CBTC safety logic is hosted in cloud.)

**CBTC project capacity claim (Chennai Metro Phase 2, 2023)**  
Hitachi stated its CBTC + ATO for Chennai Metro Phase 2 enables trains to run at up to **90-second intervals** [[8]](https://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2023/03/230316.html).

**Next-gen CBTC R&D (2026)**  
Hitachi states it is developing “SelTrac G9,” integrating **AI and 5G**, aiming for lower operating costs, improved reliability, and increased capacity [[9]](https://www.hitachirail.com/blog/hitachi-rail-invests-in-the-next-generation-rail-signaling-technology/).

### 2.3 Alstom: GoA4 CBTC deployments + cloud analytics around signaling assets (2024)
**Bengaluru Metro Phase 2 CBTC (2024)**  
Alstom won a contract to deliver GoA4 CBTC signaling and an OCC/BCC supervision setup for Bengaluru Metro Phase 2 (Reach 6 / Lines 2A and 2B) [[6]](https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2024/6/alstoms-automated-cbtc-technology-bringing-connected-and-efficient-green-mobility-bengaluru). This is a major CBTC deployment announcement; the release does not describe CBTC hosting as “cloud,” but it includes cloud-adjacent lifecycle tech:

- Alstom will deploy **HealthHub** predictive maintenance with “real-time condition-based monitoring… using advanced data analytics” [[6]](https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2024/6/alstoms-automated-cbtc-technology-bringing-connected-and-efficient-green-mobility-bengaluru).  
- HealthHub is described elsewhere by Alstom as **cloud-based**, continuously tracking rolling stock and infrastructure including signaling [[7]](https://www.alstom.com/stories/future-services-digital-healthhub).

**Reported outcomes (Alstom claims)**  
- Bengaluru Phase 2 is expected to minimize travel time “by at least 50%” (project-level claim) [[6]](https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2024/6/alstoms-automated-cbtc-technology-bringing-connected-and-efficient-green-mobility-bengaluru).  
- HealthHub: “up to 30% reduction in downtime” (product-level claim) [[7]](https://www.alstom.com/stories/future-services-digital-healthhub).

### 2.4 Other notable metro signaling modernization awards (not explicitly “cloud-hosted” in the captured sources)
These show the broader market movement toward software-defined/digital train control, even when the “cloud hosting” detail is not stated.

- **CAF – Helsinki Metro (2026)**: OPTIO CBTC modernization, new control centre, GoA2 with possible GoA3 unattended return at ends, with goals of reliability, more automation, and potential frequency increase [[11]](https://www.cafmobility.com/en/press-room/caf-to-modernise-helsinki-metro-signalling-system/), [[12]](https://www.railvolution.net/news/optio-cbtc-for-helsinki).  
- **Stadler – MARTA (Atlanta, 2024)**: modernization of train control system; Stadler highlights modularity and compatibility with wireless networks including 5G and Wi‑Fi [[13]](https://www.stadlerrail.com/api/docs/x/e2fc3dd46a/2024_1205_marta-cbtc-contract_en.pdf).  
- **SFMTA – CBTC program (document dated 2023)**: mentions a “successful Pilot” and planned broader CBTC installation, but no cloud detail is present in the snippet available [[43]](https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports-and-documents/2023/01/01-17-23_mtab_item_14_communications_based_train_control_system_rfp.pdf).

### 2.5 Hyperscaler cloud in rail: strong in digital services/testing/AI, weaker (in this dataset) for hosting vital CBTC
Within the collected sources, hyperscaler adoption is clear for **rail digital services platforms, testing environments, and AI/cybersecurity collaboration**, but **not explicitly proven for revenue-service hosting of vital CBTC/ATS**:

- **Alstom on Microsoft Azure (2023)**: centralization of applications onto an Azure-based SaaS platform; apps hosted directly in Azure with API management, identity, AKS, and SIEM tooling [[38]](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1674017054678739411-alstom-discrete-manufacturing-azure-en-france). (Not stated as CBTC core hosting.)  
- **Alstom signaling testing/validation on Azure (case study)**: Azure VMware Solution used as a scalable environment where engineers and clients perform signaling validation tests remotely [[39]](https://dxc.com/insights/customer-stories/alstom-lays-groundwork-for-more-sustainable-transportation/alstom-migrates-to-azure-to-accelerate-train-signaling-testing-lowering-energy-costs). (Engineering/test environment; not stated as operational metro CBTC.)  
- **Hitachi Rail + Google Cloud (2025)**: partnership leveraging Google Cloud cybersecurity + AI (Vertex AI) to accelerate innovation and productivity and support autonomous rail direction [[40]](https://www.hitachi.com/en-us/press/hitachi-rail-to-accelerate-rail-digital-transformation-with-google-cloud/). (Not stated as CBTC hosting.)

**Key takeaway:** In 2023–2026 materials, “cloud-based train control” in metros is most concretely evidenced as **private cloud / signaling data center** (Siemens), while **public cloud** is strongly evidenced for **adjacent digital services and engineering environments** (Alstom) and broader AI/cybersecurity programs (Hitachi + Google Cloud).

## 3) Emerging reference architectures: partitioning, data flows, and performance constraints

### 3.1 Partitioning: safety-critical vs. non-safety functions (typical pattern)
A recurring architecture pattern is:

- **Safety-critical**: ATP and safety logic (often including interlocking-like functions depending on architecture)
- **Operational/non-safety**: ATS, timetable management, traffic optimization, analytics, asset management, passenger information, etc.

**Siemens (explicit mixed-criticality co-hosting):**
- Train2Cloud: safety-critical ATP + interlocking and non-safe ATS can run on the same off-the-shelf server hardware, relying on DS3 + hardened OS to maintain safety integrity [[3]](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/global/en/portfolio/digital-solutions-software/infrastructure/signaling-x/train2cloud.html).  
- Signaling X: safety-critical interlocking logic and non-safety systems (timetable/traffic optimization) can be deployed on the same type of COTS hardware via standardized APIs [[5]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/world-premiere-siemens-proves-unique-signaling-x-solution-live-metro-operation).

**Nokia (virtualization/container framing for signaling/control):**
- RBCs, interlocking, SCADA running as VMs/containers in OT cloud implies platform partitioning and strong fabric/network criticality [[34]](https://www.nokia.com/blog/railways-harness-greater-potential-in-the-cloud/).

### 3.2 Safety platforms and redundancy models enabling “cloud-like” hosting
A core enabling concept for putting vital logic onto generic compute is **replicated execution + voting**, plus distribution across locations.

A Siemens “Interlocking in the Cloud” presentation describes DS3 as:
- **2oo2 (two-out-of-two) for safety**: safety-critical software runs in at least two parallel instances on separate CPUs; outputs compared by “safe voting” [[45]](https://international-railway-safety-council.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sonja-Steffen_Interlocking-in-the-Cloud.pdf).  
- **2oo3 for availability**: add a third instance to achieve two-out-of-three voting for improved availability [[45]](https://international-railway-safety-council.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sonja-Steffen_Interlocking-in-the-Cloud.pdf).  
- Supports **geographical redundancy** by distributing software across locations [[45]](https://international-railway-safety-council.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sonja-Steffen_Interlocking-in-the-Cloud.pdf).  
- Uses “CoreShield S2L2 Linux” as OS/IT security layer [[45]](https://international-railway-safety-council.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sonja-Steffen_Interlocking-in-the-Cloud.pdf).

This is an important architectural theme: “cloud” feasibility for SIL functions is argued not by trusting the cloud substrate alone, but by **building a safety envelope above it** (replication, voting, controlled interfaces).

### 3.3 Data flows: onboard ↔ wayside ↔ ATS/OCC ↔ cloud/data center
For CBTC, ETSI provides a generic communications picture:

- Train CBTC devices exchange data with wayside CBTC equipment (notably **Zone Controllers (ZC)** and **ATS**) via trackside radio equipment connected to a **redundant backbone network** [[22]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103580/01.02.01_60/tr_103580v010201p.pdf).  
- Trackside access points use frequency reuse planning; train radios may exist at front/rear and use alternating channels [[22]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103580/01.02.01_60/tr_103580v010201p.pdf).  

This aligns naturally with a “signaling data center” model: ZCs/ATS/interlocking functions can be centralized/virtualized (private cloud) while radio and some field interfaces remain distributed.

### 3.4 Communications performance constraints (what the sources actually quantify)
There are two types of performance constraints evidenced:

**(a) CBTC radio-level message reliability targets (ETSI TR 103 580)**  
For an example DSSS/TDMA CBTC radio system in the 5.9 GHz range, ETSI states:
- Application-level **message error rate must not exceed 1%** and link quality is designed such that it is met for **at least 99% of possible train locations** [[22]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103580/01.02.01_60/tr_103580v010201p.pdf).  
- It provides detailed RF characteristics and duty cycles and notes lack of listen-before-talk for DSSS/TDMA [[22]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103580/01.02.01_60/tr_103580v010201p.pdf).  
For an 802.11a-based CBTC system, ETSI discusses CSMA/CA collision risks and mitigation using redundancy/retransmissions and reduced channel load [[22]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103580/01.02.01_60/tr_103580v010201p.pdf).

**(b) Mission-critical telecom QoS budgets relevant to rail (FRMCS-T mapping)**  
UIC’s FRMCS-T (transition LTE variant) provides QCI packet budget delays and loss rates for mission-critical services:
- Example delay budgets include **60 ms** for delay-sensitive signaling (MC signaling) and **75–200 ms** across other MC service classes, with packet error loss targets down to **10^-6** for some classes [[17]](https://uic.org/IMG/pdf/frmcs-t_v1_0_.pdf).  
These are telecom service-layer budgets, not the full closed-loop CBTC braking-control envelope, but they matter for architectures that aim to use 4G/5G/FRMCS-like bearers for train control and supervision.

### 3.5 Failover modes and resilience patterns (network + compute)
**Network-level redundancy patterns (examples in sources):**
- Cisco’s CBTC guidance emphasizes duplicated paths at every level and even “duplicating each CBTC packet” to avoid loss [[48]](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Verticals/Transportation/Rail-CBTC/Rail_CBTC_Design_Guide.pdf).  
- ETSI notes redundancy/retransmissions are used in some 802.11-based CBTC implementations to ensure availability under CSMA/CA constraints [[22]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103580/01.02.01_60/tr_103580v010201p.pdf).

**Compute-level redundancy patterns:**
- DS3 2oo2/2oo3 voting and geo-redundant distribution [[45]](https://international-railway-safety-council.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sonja-Steffen_Interlocking-in-the-Cloud.pdf).  
- Siemens Train2Cloud claims a “hot redundancy concept” to improve availability without extra hardware [[3]](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/global/en/portfolio/digital-solutions-software/infrastructure/signaling-x/train2cloud.html).  

**Hybrid bearer resilience (FRMCS direction):**
- DB describes hybrid FRMCS networks where public mobile networks can complement railway networks as fallback/capacity boost using multipath protocols [[18]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/en/FRMCS-5G-mobile-communication).  
- FRMCS architecture (ETSI) explicitly supports multiple RATs and QoS/priority policies [[16]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103700_103799/103764/01.01.01_60/ts_103764v010101p.pdf).

## 4) Key enabling technologies (and how they fit together)

### 4.1 Virtualization, “railway cloud” compute, and lifecycle agility
**Why virtualization is central (as evidenced):**
- FRMCS work is explicitly tied to **cloud-native 5G core principles** using **NFV and SDN**, aiming for agility and long-life adaptability [[21]](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/16/8/712).  
- Virtualization is also framed as enabling **task segregation** so critical and non-critical tasks can run independently on the same platform with dedicated resources and assigned criticality levels [[21]](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/16/8/712).  

**Rail-specific safety constraints on virtualization (important):**
A SIL4 data-center report states:
- “The virtualization layer should not be safety relevant,” therefore the runtime environment must detect faulty virtualization behavior [[46]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Research%20Report%20-%20SIL4%20Data%20Center.pdf).  
- Any change in virtualization software needs to be qualified [[46]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Research%20Report%20-%20SIL4%20Data%20Center.pdf).  
This is a practical constraint that shapes how far “cloud-native” patterns can be adopted in vital signaling.

### 4.2 Deterministic networking: TSN as a foundational technology (especially for open onboard architectures)
A 2024 TSN-in-rail paper argues TSN addresses Ethernet’s lack of real-time and isolation, and states TSN is identified as the next-generation data link layer for rail communications [[47]](https://soc-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RelyUm-tsn_trains-211108.pdf). It highlights:

- **Time-Aware Shaper (802.1Qbv)** for scheduled traffic and deterministic timeslots [[47]](https://soc-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RelyUm-tsn_trains-211108.pdf)  
- **Credit Based Shaper (802.1Qav)** for reserved traffic [[47]](https://soc-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RelyUm-tsn_trains-211108.pdf)  
- **High-accuracy time synchronization using IEEE 1588** and the TSN timing/sync standard **802.1AS/ASrev** [[47]](https://soc-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RelyUm-tsn_trains-211108.pdf)  
- **Redundancy with 802.1CB** (frame replication and elimination) targeting zero-delay recovery under failures [[47]](https://soc-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RelyUm-tsn_trains-211108.pdf)

It also directly links TSN to **OCORA**, stating TSN is the proposed data link layer for real-time traffic in OCORA’s open onboard CCS reference architecture [[47]](https://soc-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RelyUm-tsn_trains-211108.pdf). (In the captured EU-Rail work program, OCORA is defined as “Open CCS On-board Reference Architecture,” and RCA as “Reference Command Control and Signalling Architecture” [[37]](https://rail-research.europa.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GB-Decision_16_Annex_WP2024.pdf).)

### 4.3 Time synchronization (PTP/NTP) and where it matters
- TSN determinism depends on precise time synchronization (IEEE 1588/PTP and TSN sync profiles) [[47]](https://soc-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RelyUm-tsn_trains-211108.pdf).  
- Nokia’s digital station network blueprint discusses distributing time sync to support LTE/5G small cells and train-to-ground systems, using IEEE 1588 and NTP [[41]](https://www.nokia.com/asset/i/212273/).  
- A SIL4 data center report flags a limitation: time synchronization across applications may not be feasible across different runtime environments (RTEs), only within the same RTE solution [[46]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Research%20Report%20-%20SIL4%20Data%20Center.pdf). This becomes significant if a “signaling cloud” hosts multi-vendor vital applications.

### 4.4 Radio evolution: from Wi‑Fi-like CBTC bearers to 5G / FRMCS-like concepts
**CBTC in 5.9 GHz (ETSI coexistence and radio tech characterization):**
- ETSI documents CBTC radio technologies in the 5.9 GHz band, including DSSS/TDMA and IEEE 802.11-based systems, and describes coexistence constraints and channelization [[22]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103580/01.02.01_60/tr_103580v010201p.pdf).  

**5G for mission-critical train-to-ground in metros/APMs:**
- Hitachi states it is replacing legacy radio/Wi‑Fi with **5G** for mission-critical signaling applications in New York and Hong Kong projects, using private 5G in NY and overlay in Hong Kong [[20]](https://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2024/09/240919a.html).  
- Siemens Train2Cloud states it supports fast 5G networks for CBTC connectivity [[3]](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/global/en/portfolio/digital-solutions-software/infrastructure/signaling-x/train2cloud.html).  

**FRMCS as a longer-term backbone concept (more mainline-focused but relevant as a template):**
- ETSI FRMCS architecture defines a transport stratum and service stratum, supports QoS/priority and multiple RATs, and treats railway applications as external “application stratum” users [[16]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103700_103799/103764/01.01.01_60/ts_103764v010101p.pdf).  
- UIC FRMCS-T emphasizes multi-band, multi-access, and multipath concepts (including non-3GPP WLAN options) [[17]](https://uic.org/IMG/pdf/frmcs-t_v1_0_.pdf).  
- DB positions FRMCS/5G as providing necessary connectivity for future digital technologies, and describes hybrid rail + public network concepts using multipath [[18]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/en/FRMCS-5G-mobile-communication).

**What is *not* evidenced in the provided sources:** Specific metro CBTC evidence for **Wi‑Fi 6/6E/7** performance/roaming design or detailed comparisons vs 5G is not present in the captured sources; ETSI material here focuses on older 802.11a-based CBTC in 5.9 GHz [[22]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103580/01.02.01_60/tr_103580v010201p.pdf).

### 4.5 Open interfaces/APIs and “platformization”
A key driver for cloud-readiness is the move toward **standardized APIs/open interfaces**:

- Siemens Signaling X emphasizes standardized APIs and “open interfaces” to integrate diagnostic and optimization systems into one cloud environment [[29]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-mobility-presents-signaling-x-and-next-level-rail-services-innotrans-2024).  
- A SIL4 data center report explicitly pushes toward standardizing behavior/interfaces so that different vendors’ runtime environments can coexist on shared COTS hardware encapsulated by VMs, positioning this as extending the OCORA vision [[46]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Research%20Report%20-%20SIL4%20Data%20Center.pdf).

### 4.6 Data/AI platforms tied to train control outcomes (energy, availability, maintenance)
- Siemens frames Signaling X as making data available for AI applications in the future [[5]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/world-premiere-siemens-proves-unique-signaling-x-solution-live-metro-operation).  
- Alstom HealthHub cloud analytics is positioned as improving availability and maintenance decision-making, with a downtime reduction claim [[7]](https://www.alstom.com/stories/future-services-digital-healthhub).  
- Hitachi’s Google Cloud partnership is explicitly about cloud + cybersecurity + AI to accelerate innovation and move toward autonomous rail [[40]](https://www.hitachi.com/en-us/press/hitachi-rail-to-accelerate-rail-digital-transformation-with-google-cloud/).  
- Alstom’s Azure platform example shows how energy consumption measurement and operational train management data can be integrated in a cloud platform to feed real-time guidance and broader service apps [[38]](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1674017054678739411-alstom-discrete-manufacturing-azure-en-france).

## 5) Safety assurance and certification approaches for cloud-based train control

### 5.1 Core problem: cloud characteristics vs. safety timing and evidence requirements
A Digitale Schiene Deutschland “SIL4 Cloud” report highlights key safety-case challenges when moving SIL functions to cloud infrastructure:

- Traditional cloud environments rely on fast but **asynchronous networks**, meaning messages can be delayed indefinitely, conflicting with predefined fault detection/handling time intervals used in safety arguments [[24]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Report%20-%20SIL4%20Cloud.pdf).  
- Distributed replicas have their own clocks; the report proposes arguing safe operation via **reliable/safe time synchronization** provided as a dedicated cloud service [[24]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Report%20-%20SIL4%20Cloud.pdf).  
- Safety cases require evidence for sufficiently low failure rates (MTBF), but cloud COTS hardware may not have trustworthy MTBF evidence; the report suggests pessimistic estimation and using **replication schemes** to reach required values [[24]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Report%20-%20SIL4%20Cloud.pdf).

### 5.2 Migration practicality differs by subsystem (interlocking vs. RBC vs. CBTC components)
The same SIL4 cloud report argues:

- **RBCs** are centralized and can be migrated “relatively easily and smoothly” onto a SIL4 cloud if they have modern architectures and use IP protocols [[24]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Report%20-%20SIL4%20Cloud.pdf).  
- **Interlockings** are harder because of legacy field wiring constraints; newer “object-controller” concepts with IP links are more cloud-friendly, but legacy migration is case-by-case and often constrained by remaining physical infrastructure [[24]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Report%20-%20SIL4%20Cloud.pdf).

Even though this is framed for mainline interlocking/RBC, the underlying lesson applies directly to metro signaling: **functions that already have clean IP interfaces and centralized roles are the first candidates for cloud-like hosting**; functions tightly coupled to legacy field hardware migrate later.

### 5.3 Concrete safety mechanisms used to justify COTS compute for SIL functions
Siemens DS3 material provides a specific mechanism: **diversity + redundancy + voting** (2oo2/2oo3) and geo-distribution [[45]](https://international-railway-safety-council.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sonja-Steffen_Interlocking-in-the-Cloud.pdf). This is an archetypal safety pattern for “SIL on COTS.”

### 5.4 Standards context and rail practice signals (what’s evidenced here)
- A SIL4 Data Center report lists the homologation basis as **EN 50126-1/-2, EN 50129, EN 50128, EN 50159** and notes EN 50129 allows inclusion of complex hardware/software developed outside safety processes, with a framework for proving safety of systems built on COTS components [[46]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Research%20Report%20-%20SIL4%20Data%20Center.pdf).  
- UK RSSB’s June 2023 standards update notes “online key management” is addressed in a CCS standard update and that defect management guidance includes new reporting guidance on software/cybersecurity issues [[25]](https://www.rssb.co.uk/standards/using-standards/latest-updates-to-standards/june-2023-standards-update). This reflects the increasing coupling of signaling assurance with cybersecurity/crypto operational readiness.

**What is not directly provided in the captured sources:** clause-level regulator positions on accepting public cloud for vital CBTC in metros are not contained here; the ORR authorisations page is a listing and does not provide cloud policy detail [[30]](https://www.orr.gov.uk/guidance-compliance/rail/health-safety/laws/interoperability/authorisations).

## 6) Cybersecurity and resilience developments (2023–2026) for cloud-connected train control

### 6.1 Railway cybersecurity engineering is converging on IEC 62443 + rail lifecycle alignment (TS 50701)
A 2023 presentation on **CLC/TS 50701** (2nd edition published Aug 2023) states TS 50701 is based on **IEC 62443** and **EN 50126** lifecycle concepts [[27]](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/all_files/05-standards-02-cenelec-christian-schlehuber.pdf). Key practices highlighted:

- **Zones and conduits** partitioning in early lifecycle phases [[27]](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/all_files/05-standards-02-cenelec-christian-schlehuber.pdf)  
- A living **cybersecurity management plan** covering roles, interfaces to safety/RAM/V&V, information protection, threat/risk methodology, and vulnerability management [[27]](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/all_files/05-standards-02-cenelec-christian-schlehuber.pdf)  
- Production of a **cybersecurity case**, and an explicit linkage pattern: the **safety case references the cybersecurity report**, and security-related assumptions/conditions can be managed as application conditions (SecRAC) [[27]](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/all_files/05-standards-02-cenelec-christian-schlehuber.pdf).

This is directly relevant for cloud-connected CBTC because cloud increases the number of interfaces, shared services, and supply-chain dependencies—exactly what zone/conduit modeling and cybersecurity case practices are meant to control.

### 6.2 “Connectivity + COTS + remote access” increases attack surface (government framing)
UK DfT guidance explicitly warns that rail systems become more vulnerable due to moving from bespoke stand-alone systems to **open-platform standardized equipment using COTS** and increasing use of networked control systems accessible remotely via public/private networks [[26]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efcace9e90e075c52d05a94/rail-cyber-security-guidance-to-industry-document.pdf). This maps directly onto “cloud-based signaling data centers” and hybrid connectivity.

### 6.3 Security architecture practices: defense-in-depth, monitoring, and incident learnings
A Siemens Mobility 2025 cybersecurity white paper emphasizes a **defense-in-depth** approach (identify, protect, detect, recover) and references rail incident examples including WannaCry impacts at Deutsche Bahn and 2023 radio-signal manipulation stopping trains in Poland, which Siemens attributes to unencrypted radio communications [[28]](https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:78855a92-ddb8-46f3-af38-a5d57920f3e4/Cybersecurity-whitepaper.pdf). (These are Siemens-described incident summaries; they still illustrate why encryption/authentication and monitoring matter for train-control-adjacent communications.)

### 6.4 Zero trust in OT: caution around essential functions
A CSA summary of guidance aligned with ISA/IEC 62443 notes a recommendation that zero trust should **not** be introduced in ways that override or interrupt “essential functions” in OT, especially safety functions in fault-tolerant designs [[32]](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/resources/zero-trust-outcomes-for-ot-using-isa-iec-62443-standards). For CBTC, this reinforces an important practical rule: **security controls must be designed so they do not break deterministic safety behavior** (e.g., poorly placed authentication gateways adding latency or causing denial-of-service to vital flows).

### 6.5 Telecom-security specifics that matter for cloud-connected train control
FRMCS architecture (ETSI) specifies **Local Binding** for onboard apps to onboard FRMCS, establishing a **TLS-backed mutually authenticated control-plane link**, and similar concepts trackside via TS_APP reference points [[16]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103700_103799/103764/01.01.01_60/ts_103764v010101p.pdf). This is a concrete example of how future rail telecom stacks embed security into service access—relevant to cloud/edge applications that consume the telecom services.

## 7) Practical synthesis for urban rail operators: what the “cloud-based train control stack” looks like now

Based on the 2023–2026 evidence, a realistic cloud-based train control stack in metros tends to converge to:

1. **COTS compute + virtualization in a private signaling data center (OT cloud)**  
   - Host safety and non-safety workloads with strong partitioning and safety envelopes (replication/voting) [[3]](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/global/en/portfolio/digital-solutions-software/infrastructure/signaling-x/train2cloud.html), [[5]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/world-premiere-siemens-proves-unique-signaling-x-solution-live-metro-operation), [[45]](https://international-railway-safety-council.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sonja-Steffen_Interlocking-in-the-Cloud.pdf), [[46]](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/Downloads/Research%20Report%20-%20SIL4%20Data%20Center.pdf).  
2. **Redundant IP networking + deterministic building blocks**  
   - Redundant backbone and wayside networks; packet duplication / multi-path patterns for vital flows [[48]](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Verticals/Transportation/Rail-CBTC/Rail_CBTC_Design_Guide.pdf), and increasing use of deterministic Ethernet (TSN) for mixed-criticality onboard networks and open architectures [[47]](https://soc-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RelyUm-tsn_trains-211108.pdf).  
3. **Modern radio bearers (5G/private cellular) as a major new lever**  
   - CBTC train-to-ground over 5G in real deployments/overlays is now an explicit direction (Hitachi) [[20]](https://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2024/09/240919a.html).  
4. **Cloud analytics and maintenance platforms**  
   - Predictive maintenance and asset-health platforms are already cloud-based and widely deployed (e.g., HealthHub) [[7]](https://www.alstom.com/stories/future-services-digital-healthhub).  
5. **Cybersecurity engineering integrated with safety assurance**  
   - TS 50701-style zones/conduits + cybersecurity case linked to safety case [[27]](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/all_files/05-standards-02-cenelec-christian-schlehuber.pdf); defense-in-depth and careful OT-safe security design [[28]](https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:78855a92-ddb8-46f3-af38-a5d57920f3e4/Cybersecurity-whitepaper.pdf), [[32]](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/resources/zero-trust-outcomes-for-ot-using-isa-iec-62443-standards).

## 8) Near-term outlook (2026→) implied by the current trajectory
- **More “platformization” of signaling**: Siemens is explicitly showing CBTC functions in private cloud environments and pushing centralized signaling platforms with standardized APIs [[5]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/world-premiere-siemens-proves-unique-signaling-x-solution-live-metro-operation), [[29]](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-mobility-presents-signaling-x-and-next-level-rail-services-innotrans-2024).  
- **5G becomes the default modernization narrative**: Hitachi’s metro/APM signaling over 5G and continued R&D integrating AI + 5G suggests communications modernization is tightly coupled to future train control capability [[20]](https://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2024/09/240919a.html), [[9]](https://www.hitachirail.com/blog/hitachi-rail-invests-in-the-next-generation-rail-signaling-technology/).  
- **FRMCS timeline continues to shape expectations**: UIC describes a roadmap toward a “1st Edition” enabling deployments in Europe around 2027, with specification maturation through 2026 [[17]](https://uic.org/IMG/pdf/frmcs-t_v1_0_.pdf); FRMCS’ cloud-native NFV/SDN framing reinforces virtualization as a long-term foundation [[21]](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/16/8/712).  
- **Cybersecurity case discipline becomes non-optional** as more safety-adjacent functions become software-defined and remotely updatable [[27]](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/all_files/05-standards-02-cenelec-christian-schlehuber.pdf), [[26]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efcace9e90e075c52d05a94/rail-cyber-security-guidance-to-industry-document.pdf), [[28]](https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:78855a92-ddb8-46f3-af38-a5d57920f3e4/Cybersecurity-whitepaper.pdf).

### If you tell me one metro context (e.g., greenfield GoA4 vs brownfield resignaling; Wi‑Fi CBTC today vs LTE/5G; single line vs multi-line network), I can map these developments into a concrete target architecture (functions placed onboard vs wayside edge vs signaling data center vs enterprise cloud), and highlight which parts are typically certifiable as safety-related vs operational, and where latency/redundancy constraints are tightest given the radio/backbone choices evidenced in the sources.
