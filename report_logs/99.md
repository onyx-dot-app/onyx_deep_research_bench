ANSWER:
## 1) Where light-based therapies sit today in aesthetic medicine (2024–2026)

Light-based therapies are used less as “skin whitening” in a literal sense and more as **targeted correction of dyschromia** (spots, mottled pigmentation, melasma), **photodamage reversal** (fine rhytids/texture/pores), and **overall tone “brightening”** (more even chromophore distribution + improved scattering from dermal remodeling). In current practice, the biggest differentiators across devices are:

- **Target type & depth**
  - **Discrete epidermal lesions** (solar lentigines/age spots): often best served by pigment-targeting lasers or IPL, frequently with **1–2 sessions** [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11948172/).
  - **Diffuse, chronic pigment disorders with vascular/inflammatory drivers** (melasma): first-line remains **photoprotection + topicals**, with procedures **reserved for refractory cases** due to recurrence and PIH risk [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/).
  - **Photoaging with diffuse dyschromia** (texture + spots + pores): commonly treated with **nonablative fractional lasers** (e.g., 1550/1927 nm), **fractional picosecond platforms**, and increasingly **home/clinic LED photobiomodulation (PBM)** for low-downtime maintenance [[8]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12104010/), [[9]](https://journals.lww.com/dermatologicsurgery/fulltext/2025/01000/nonablative_fractional_diode_laser_resurfacing.12.aspx), [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12014787/), [[11]](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/02140/clinical_study_to_evaluate_the_efficacy_and_safety.27.aspx).

- **Mechanism of action**
  - **Photothermal selective injury** (IPL; longer-pulse lasers; fractional 1550/1927): good for blended photodamage (pigment + redness + texture), but requires careful parameter selection in darker skin.
  - **Photoacoustic/photomechanical injury** (Q-switched/picosecond): efficient pigment fragmentation with less bulk heating; newer fractional picosecond optics add remodeling benefits [[13]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9852188/).
  - **Photobiomodulation** (LED/PBM): non-ablative signaling effects (cellular metabolism, inflammation modulation), slower but low-risk and suitable for repeated use [[23]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11049838/).

## 2) Current clinical applications by condition

### A) Photoaging (wrinkles, texture, pores, radiance; often with dyschromia)
**Most common light-based choices**
1. **Nonablative fractional lasers (NAFL)**  
   - Widely used due to meaningful improvements with less downtime than ablative resurfacing; still causes short-term erythema/edema and PIH risk in skin of color [[8]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12104010/).  
   - Example evidence:
     - **1440 nm + 1927 nm nonablative fractional diode combination**: four monthly treatments produced significant improvements in rhytides, texture, dyschromia/pigment, radiance, pores, and overall appearance, with no serious AEs reported and high satisfaction [[9]](https://journals.lww.com/dermatologicsurgery/fulltext/2025/01000/nonablative_fractional_diode_laser_resurfacing.12.aspx). (Industry support/conflicts were disclosed, which should temper confidence in effect magnitude reporting [[9]](https://journals.lww.com/dermatologicsurgery/fulltext/2025/01000/nonablative_fractional_diode_laser_resurfacing.12.aspx).)
     - **Fractionated 1927 nm** (MOXI) for diffuse dyspigmentation/actinic irregularities: two sessions one month apart significantly reduced VISIA “spots/UV spots/brown spots” at 1 month; some rebound toward baseline by 3 months, though brown spots remained improved [[35]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36950878/).

2. **Fractional picosecond lasers (rejuvenation + pigment + pores)**
   - Used increasingly for patients wanting collagen remodeling and pigment improvement with relatively favorable downtime profiles.
   - Evidence highlights:
     - Mechanistic framing: fractional optics concentrate energy into microspots with surrounding low-fluence background, enabling **laser-induced optical breakdown/cavitation** patterns that can stimulate regeneration/remodeling [[13]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9852188/).
     - Prospective study using **fractional 532 + 1064 nm picosecond** (three monthly sessions) showed at least moderate improvement in pigmentation (93% of patients) and fine lines (79%) at 1 month post-course [[14]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34608097/).
     - Long-term split-face RCT in Asian patients using **755 nm picosecond alexandrite with diffractive lens array** reported sustained superiority in dyschromia/texture/rhytids on the treated side up to **36 months** (small sample; subjective scales) [[15]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/lsm.23393).

3. **LED / photobiomodulation (PBM)**
   - Used as a **low-risk** option for fine lines, recovery support, and maintenance—especially via home devices.
   - Evidence examples:
     - Home-use mask combining **630 nm LED + 850 nm infrared** used 9 minutes, 5×/week for 12 weeks improved crow’s feet scores versus sham through week 16 in Asian participants (Fitzpatrick II–V) [[11]](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/02140/clinical_study_to_evaluate_the_efficacy_and_safety.27.aspx).
     - A sham-controlled RCT of **660 nm red LED mask** (8 vs 12 sessions over 4 weeks) found objective wrinkle-length reductions on ImageJ for glabellar and periorbital wrinkles and improved FACE-Q satisfaction; photographic WAS differences were not significant [[38]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167796/).
     - Broader-spectrum near-IR LED (600–900 nm) reported improvements in wrinkle count and skin measures without adverse events in a small cohort; control status is unclear from the available excerpt, limiting certainty [[12]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00266-025-05476-6).

**How “brightening” happens in photoaging protocols**
- Reduction in mottled pigment + improved erythema + dermal remodeling (collagen/elastin) changes how light scatters, giving perceived “radiance.”
- Post-procedure skincare is increasingly treated as part of the protocol: a split-face trial after Fraxel (1550/1927) found that a **vitamin C/E/ferulic** regimen reduced erythema score change and improved melanin index/hydration and satisfaction versus saline [[8]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12104010/).

---

### B) Solar lentigines / age spots (discrete lesions)
This is the “sweet spot” for energy-based pigment clearance.

**What’s most used now**
- **Pigment-targeting lasers** (532 nm QS or picosecond; 694 ruby; etc.) and **IPL** are standard options; typically **1–2 sessions** in many trials [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11948172/).

**Comparative evidence and key takeaways**
- A 2025 systematic review of solar lentigines trials concluded physical therapies (laser, IPL, etc.) are generally effective; common adverse effects include pain and PIH (usually mild/transient), with **PDL and IPL seemingly less likely** to cause PIH among laser/IPL-type options in the reviewed literature [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11948172/).
- A high-yield split-face RCT (Fitzpatrick III–V) compared **single-session 532 nm picosecond vs 532 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG**:
  - Better clearance with picosecond (QIS 2.95 vs 1.8 at 12 weeks) and lower PIH incidence (5% vs 30%, borderline p-value) [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/).
  - This supports the real-world trend toward **shorter pulse durations** to reduce collateral thermal injury while maintaining efficacy.

**IPL in lentigines**
- The lentigines review summarizes multiple IPL studies with high rates of good-to-excellent improvement and, in some protocols, **no PIH** reported (study-dependent) [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11948172/). Filters (e.g., 515 nm/KTP-type filters) and technique strongly influence outcomes.

**Combination “modern” workflows**
- A 2024 report described same-day **BBL HERO (advanced IPL) followed by 1927 nm nonablative fractional laser (MOXI)** for lentigines, with VISIA improvement in brown spots and no AEs in a small series; sequencing matters (pulsed light first, then laser) due to post-laser erythema [[22]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11460752/). (Conflict disclosure: author is a KOL with honoraria [[22]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11460752/).)

---

### C) Melasma (epidermal/dermal/mixed; high recurrence; PIH-prone)
Melasma is now widely framed as a disorder involving **pigment + inflammation + vascular change + barrier dysfunction**, not pigment alone [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12795099/), [[20]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9351870/), [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/). It is also chronic and psychologically burdensome [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/), [[6]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajd.70051).

**Consensus positioning (what’s “current” in 2024–2026)**
- International modified Delphi consensus (Pigmentary Disorders Society; literature 2014–2024):  
  - **Photoprotection is essential**; hydroquinone-based triple combination (where regulated) is **gold standard** under supervision; adjuncts include azelaic acid/kojic acid/oral TXA; procedures like peels/microneedling can be adjunctive.  
  - **Lasers are reserved for refractory cases** [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/).

**What evidence says about lasers/lights in melasma (and the trade-offs)**
- **Laser/light + topical combinations** (RCT meta-analysis through Aug 2024):
  - No significant advantage at 4 weeks, but significant MASI/mMASI improvements at 8–16 weeks (SMD about −0.55 overall) [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12795099/).
  - Safety: combination arms had **higher adverse event risk** (OR ~8.96), driven mainly by erythema and PIH; evidence certainty was *very low* for safety [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12795099/).
  - Practical implication: the combination can work, but clinicians must plan for **higher irritation/PIH risk** and manage expectations.

- **“Net laser therapy” RCT meta-analysis (2010–2024 RCTs)**:
  - Overall MASI improved across trials (pooled effect reported), with QS 1064 Nd:YAG most studied; protocols were heterogeneous (2–12 sessions; 1–4 week intervals; follow-up 2–6 months) [[25]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12696807/).  
  - Practical implication: lasers can reduce severity short-term in many patients, but heterogeneity and recurrence concerns remain central.

- **Picosecond 755 nm alexandrite for melasma** (2026 meta-analysis of RCTs):
  - Found PSAL **inferior to triple combination cream** for MASI reduction; PIH more common vs topical creams (OR ~6.86) [[6]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajd.70051).  
  - Practical implication: picosecond does not automatically mean “better” for melasma; topicals remain first-line, and device use needs careful selection.

**Head-to-head and parameter-refinement trials (what’s “recent advancement” clinically)**
- Split-face comparison (30 women): **fractional 675 nm diode** vs **low-fluence QS 1064**—both improved scores; diode side reported superior improvement with mild transient AEs [[27]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12528302/). (This supports exploration of wavelengths beyond classic 1064 “toning,” but it’s one study.)
- RCT (40 women, skin type III–IV): **picosecond alexandrite 755** vs **combined Q-switched + long-pulse Nd:YAG 1064**  
  - Both improved MASI; Nd:YAG combo improved more; picosecond arm had higher pain and slightly more reactions; recurrence at 24 weeks 10.5% vs 0% (not statistically significant in report) [[28]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10103-025-04286-1).
- Split-face trial with 12-month follow-up: **LFQS 1064 alone** vs **LFQS + microsecond pulse-width mode**  
  - MASI improved early (1–3 months) but not sustained statistically at 6–12 months; melanin index durability favored the combined-mode side at 12 months, suggesting potential relapse mitigation [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).

**IPL “pulse-technology” advances targeting melasma’s vascular/inflammatory axis**
- AOPT IPL has been positioned as an advancement because pulse trains can be shaped (sub-pulse energy/width control) to reduce overheating while affecting pigment/vascular targets.
- Clinical + mechanistic study (guinea pig model + 20 patients) using **AOPT low-energy triple-pulse long-width mode** reported reduced mMASI and erythema index and downregulation of melanogenesis/inflammation/angiogenesis markers, with emphasis on mast cell infiltration and **SCF/c-KIT** pathway inhibition [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/).  
  - Practical implication: this supports the modern idea that melasma improvement may require addressing **erythema/angiogenesis/mast-cell biology**, not only melanin.
- Smaller case series (10 patients, 8 monthly sessions) of **IPL AOPT + barrier “repair dressing”** reported mMASI reduction and stable results at 4 months post-course (uncontrolled; small) [[20]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9351870/).  
  - Practical implication: reinforces the growing practice pattern of **pairing energy-based treatments with barrier-supportive aftercare** in melasma.

**LED/PBM in melasma**
- Pilot RCT: **amber PBM vs topical TXA** found no MASI or PGA improvement (underpowered), but quality-of-life improved and AEs were mild [[5]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10103-025-04567-9).  
- Integrative review of PBM for melasma identified nine studies, with wavelengths commonly **585–590 (amber/yellow), 630 (red), 830–850 (NIR)** and radiant exposures **1–20 J/cm²**; concludes potential benefit but need for robust trials and parameter optimization [[30]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12935).
- There is a referenced RCT comparing **home 590 nm LED** vs **in-hospital 1064 QS Nd:YAG** for melasma, but accessible records do not provide outcomes (no abstract available), so it cannot be used to quantify comparative efficacy here [[32]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37703182/).

---

## 3) Recent scientific and technological advancements (past ~5 years) that matter clinically

### A) Picosecond platforms + fractional optics (major trend)
Key advancements are less about “picosecond” alone and more about *how* it is delivered:

- **Ultrashort pulses (≈300–900 ps)** generate strong photoacoustic effects with reduced thermal diffusion compared with nanosecond pulses [[13]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9852188/).
- **Fractional optical delivery** (diffractive lens arrays, microlens arrays, holographic arrays) creates micro-injury zones that can drive remodeling and pigment improvement while leaving intervening tissue intact, supporting faster recovery profiles [[13]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9852188/).
- Clinical impact signals:
  - Photoaging/dyschromia improvements in prospective and long-term split-face data [[14]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34608097/), [[15]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/lsm.23393).
  - Better PIH profile in lentigines vs Q-switched 532 in a higher-phototype cohort [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/).

### B) Refinement of “laser toning” and hybrid pulse strategies in melasma
- Low-fluence QS 1064 “toning” remains widely used (especially in Asia), typically **many sessions** with large spots and faint erythema endpoints; it is viewed as generally effective but associated with risks like mottled hypopigmentation with high cumulative energy and recurrence after stopping [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323185/).
- Newer studies explore **dual-mode pulses** (nanosecond + microsecond) to improve erythema/vascular components and possibly reduce relapse [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).

### C) IPL advances: faster delivery, better cooling, more filtering, and pulse-shaping
- Device-level changes (e.g., higher repetition rates, enhanced cooling, broader filter ecosystems) and technique evolution (multi-pass “global” treatment and two-step lesion targeting) are emphasized as improving uniformity and reducing striping/burn risk [[19]](https://sciton.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Intense-Pulsed-Light-Where-Are-We-Now-DERMATOLOGIC_REVIEW_MARCH_2021.pdf). (Note: this is a manufacturer-hosted review; technical descriptions may be accurate, but comparative superlatives should be treated cautiously [[19]](https://sciton.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Intense-Pulsed-Light-Where-Are-We-Now-DERMATOLOGIC_REVIEW_MARCH_2021.pdf).)
- “AOPT” pulse train shaping (sub-pulse control) is supported by mechanistic/clinical evidence linking protocol to reduced melanogenesis + inflammation + angiogenesis and improvement in both pigment and erythema indices in melasma [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/).

### D) Combination workflows (light + fractional laser; fractional laser + topical delivery; structured aftercare)
- Same-day **IPL + 1927 nm fractional** combination for lentigines/dyschromia is an example of workflow integration, with attention to sequencing to avoid confounding erythema [[22]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11460752/).
- Fractional 1927 thulium has been explored for **laser-assisted TXA delivery** in recalcitrant melasma; a split-face pilot found both sides improved, with no clear advantage to TXA side early, but the regimen was considered safe and effective short-term [[18]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32506227/).
- Post-laser anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory skincare can measurably affect erythema and melanin indices after NAFL, reflecting a “total protocol” approach rather than device-only thinking [[8]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12104010/).

### E) Growth of evidence-based home-use PBM
- Randomized sham-controlled data exist for home LED masks improving wrinkles in diverse Fitzpatrick types in Asian cohorts [[11]](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/02140/clinical_study_to_evaluate_the_efficacy_and_safety.27.aspx), and for red LED dosing frequency effects on objective wrinkle measures and satisfaction [[38]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167796/).  
- The field still lacks standardization across wavelengths/dose schedules, repeatedly emphasized in PBM reviews [[23]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11049838/), [[30]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12935).

## 4) Mechanisms of action that best explain outcomes (and complications)

### A) Pigment targeting: why wavelength + pulse duration matter
- **Melanin absorption** is higher at shorter visible wavelengths (e.g., 532 nm) than at 1064 nm, generally making shorter wavelengths efficient for superficial epidermal pigment but also increasing epidermal thermal risk in darker skin.
- **Q-switched nanosecond** and **picosecond** pulses primarily drive **photomechanical/photoacoustic** disruption of pigment. Picosecond pulses can increase peak power and acoustic effects, potentially fragmenting pigment with less bulk heat spread—one reason PIH may be lower in some comparisons (e.g., 532 ps vs 532 ns lentigines trial) [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/), [[13]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9852188/).

### B) Fractional photothermolysis: dermal remodeling + dyspigmentation blending
- Nonablative fractional systems (e.g., 1550/1927) create microscopic columns of thermal injury (microthermal zones) that drive collagen remodeling, texture improvement, and gradual dyschromia blending. Clinical studies show improvements across multiple photoaging domains, including dyschromia/pigment [[9]](https://journals.lww.com/dermatologicsurgery/fulltext/2025/01000/nonablative_fractional_diode_laser_resurfacing.12.aspx).

### C) Melasma as pigment + inflammation + vascular disorder
Multiple sources emphasize melasma’s complexity and recurrence propensity [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12795099/), [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323185/), [[20]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9351870/), [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/). Mechanisms that are increasingly targeted:
- **Inflammation and barrier disruption** (procedures can worsen inflammation → melanogenesis → rebound) [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12795099/), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323185/), [[20]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9351870/).
- **Vascular/angiogenic components and erythema**: melasma lesions often exhibit erythema and vascular changes; targeting these may improve outcomes and possibly recurrence [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/).
- **Mast cells and SCF/c-KIT** signaling: AOPT-LTL IPL study reported downregulation of SCF/c-KIT pathway, reduced mast cell infiltration, reduced inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors, and alleviation of photoaging markers in model + clinical improvement [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/). (This is an important mechanistic bridge between “pulse technology” and biologic targets beyond melanin.)

### D) Photobiomodulation (LED/PBM): signaling rather than destruction
PBM uses red/NIR/amber light at non-ablative irradiances to modulate cellular activity:
- Reviews describe interaction with endogenous chromophores (notably mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase), affecting signaling pathways that can influence inflammation, healing, collagen production, and potentially melanogenesis regulation [[23]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11049838/), [[30]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12935).
- PBM studies in melasma commonly use 585–590, 630, 830–850 nm and 1–20 J/cm² exposures, but optimal parameters remain uncertain [[30]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12935).

## 5) Comparative clinical evidence (what works best for what)

### A) Solar lentigines
**Best-supported: pigment-targeting lasers and IPL**
- Strong head-to-head evidence: **532 nm picosecond > 532 nm Q-switched** for clearance and likely PIH reduction in darker phototypes [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/).
- Systematic review synthesis supports effectiveness of multiple laser types and IPL, with PIH as the key trade-off; PDL and IPL may be relatively lower PIH risk options in some contexts [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11948172/).

**Durability**
- Many lentigines studies follow weeks–months; longer-term recurrence depends heavily on photoprotection and ongoing sun exposure (not well standardized across trials).

### B) Melasma
**Most reliable first-line efficacy still comes from topical regimens + photoprotection**
- Consensus explicitly keeps lasers as **refractory-only** due to recurrence and PIH [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/).
- PSAL meta-analysis suggests **triple combination cream outperforms 755 ps alexandrite** on MASI and has lower PIH than PSAL [[6]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajd.70051).

**Where devices can add value**
- Combination laser/light + topical therapy shows cumulative benefit by 8–16 weeks but at a cost of more AEs including PIH [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12795099/).
- Parameter refinement and modality selection (e.g., hybrid QS pulse strategies; some fractional approaches; carefully selected IPL pulse trains) may help address erythema/vascular drivers and relapse dynamics [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/), [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).

**Durability/recurrence signals**
- Recurrence at 24 weeks reported in one RCT: 10.5% PSAL vs 0% combined Nd:YAG approach (not statistically significant in that report) [[28]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10103-025-04286-1).
- 12-month follow-up split-face study shows early MASI improvement not sustained statistically at 6–12 months, highlighting relapse reality; objective MI favored combined-mode side at 12 months [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).

### C) Diffuse dyschromia / “brightening” in photoaging
- Fractionated 1927 nm shows significant early VISIA improvements with partial rebound by 3 months, suggesting **maintenance** (additional sessions, topical regimens, photoprotection) is often required [[35]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36950878/).
- Fractional picosecond approaches show multi-domain improvement and can have favorable downtime vs some fractional thermal approaches in split-face photorejuvenation comparisons [[36]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32285983/).

### D) LED/PBM (rejuvenation; emerging for pigment)
- Best RCT evidence is currently stronger for **wrinkle improvement** and satisfaction than for definitive pigment clearance [[11]](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/02140/clinical_study_to_evaluate_the_efficacy_and_safety.27.aspx), [[38]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167796/).
- For melasma, PBM evidence is promising but not yet standardized; a pilot RCT did not show MASI improvement (underpowered) [[5]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10103-025-04567-9), while reviews compile mechanistic rationale and small-study signals [[30]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12935).

## 6) Practical “today” protocols and parameters (as reported in recent studies)

### A) Solar lentigines (example laser parameters)
- **532 nm picosecond Nd:YAG** (split-face RCT): 450 ps; 3–4 mm spot; 0.3–0.5 J/cm²; 2 Hz; endpoint slight whitening [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/).  
- **532 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG** comparator: 10 ns; 0.6–0.8 J/cm²; same spot; endpoint slight whitening [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/).  
- Key practical point: in higher phototypes (III–V), picosecond achieved better clearance and lower PIH signal [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/).

### B) Photoaging + dyschromia (fractional approaches)
- **1440 + 1927 nm nonablative fractional diode combo**: 4 monthly sessions; improved pigment/radiance/texture etc.; minimal erythema/edema; no serious AEs reported [[9]](https://journals.lww.com/dermatologicsurgery/fulltext/2025/01000/nonablative_fractional_diode_laser_resurfacing.12.aspx).
- **Fractionated 1927 nm** for diffuse dyspigmentation: 15 mJ; 15% density; 6 passes; 2 sessions 1 month apart; VISIA pigment improvements at 1 month with partial rebound at 3 months [[35]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36950878/).

### C) Melasma (selected examples)
- **Fractional 675 nm diode vs LFQS 1064** (split-face): 5 sessions, every 2 weeks; both improved; diode superior in this study; mild transient AEs [[27]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12528302/).
- **Hybrid QS strategies**: LFQS alone vs LFQS + microsecond pulse-width mode, 5–10 sessions at 1-month intervals, follow-up to 12 months; objective indices suggest potential relapse mitigation [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).
- **IPL AOPT-LTL** (mechanistic + clinical): 3 monthly sessions in 20 patients improved mMASI and erythema index with mechanistic suppression of melanogenesis/inflammation/angiogenesis markers [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/).

### D) LED/PBM (home and clinic)
- **630 + 850 nm home mask**: 9 minutes; 5×/week; 12 weeks; improved crow’s feet vs sham through 16 weeks [[11]](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/02140/clinical_study_to_evaluate_the_efficacy_and_safety.27.aspx).
- **660 nm red LED mask**: irradiance ~6.4 mW/cm²; fluence ~8.05 J/cm²; 21 minutes per session; 8 or 12 sessions over 4 weeks; improved objective wrinkle-length measures and satisfaction vs sham [[38]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167796/).
- Melasma PBM review ranges: wavelengths 585–590, 630, 830–850 nm; radiant exposures 1–20 J/cm² (but no universal protocol) [[30]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12935).

## 7) Safety, contraindications, and how practice adapts for darker phototypes / melasma-prone patients

### Core risk: PIH and rebound hyperpigmentation
- PIH risk is repeatedly emphasized for melasma and for procedures in skin of color [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12795099/), [[8]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12104010/), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323185/).
- Quantified example (lentigines): PIH 5% with 532 ps vs 30% with 532 ns after one session in phototypes III–V [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/).
- In melasma, adverse events (erythema + PIH) were significantly more frequent in combined laser/light + topical regimens vs controls in an RCT meta-analysis (OR ~8.96) [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12795099/).

### Why melasma is uniquely high-risk for device-based therapy
- Laser/light can provoke inflammation; melasma is already inflammation/vascular/barrier dysregulated, and relapse is common [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323185/), [[20]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9351870/), [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/). This underpins the consensus stance to reserve lasers for refractory cases [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/).

### Risk-reduction strategies reflected across the literature
- **Patient selection & expectation-setting**
  - Treat melasma as chronic: plan maintenance and discuss relapse [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323185/), [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).
- **Conservative parameters + test spots**
  - Especially for Fitzpatrick IV–VI or prior PIH history.
- **Protocol design to minimize thermal load**
  - Low-fluence multi-session approaches (e.g., QS “toning”) but with attention to cumulative energy and mottled hypopigmentation risk [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323185/).
  - Pulse shaping in IPL (AOPT) to control heating and address erythema/angiogenesis components [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/).
- **Photoprotection is non-negotiable**
  - Central in consensus and in recurrence discussions [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/), [[26]](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/5/1468).  
  - Real-world data show behavioral factors (sun exposure time) affect pigment endpoints after rejuvenation lasers [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12014787/).
- **Barrier/inflammation management**
  - Post-procedure antioxidant care improved erythema and melanin indices after Fraxel [[8]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12104010/).
  - Barrier-supportive approaches were combined with IPL in melasma case series [[20]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9351870/).

### Evidence caveats and bias signals you should factor in
- Several newer device studies are small, uncontrolled, and/or have conflicts:
  - 675 nm melasma case series had n=8 and author employment ties to manufacturer; interpret durability claims cautiously [[3]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1089/photob.2025.0044).
  - 1440/1927 diode combo resurfacing study disclosed industry support and funded writing assistance [[9]](https://journals.lww.com/dermatologicsurgery/fulltext/2025/01000/nonablative_fractional_diode_laser_resurfacing.12.aspx).
  - BBL HERO + MOXI lentigines report disclosed KOL relationship/honoraria [[22]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11460752/).
  - PBM vs TXA melasma RCT was underpowered due to early termination [[5]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10103-025-04567-9).

## 8) How clinicians typically choose modality (a practical synthesis)

### If the main issue is **discrete age spots / lentigines**
- **First choices**: 532 nm pigment lasers (increasingly picosecond if available/appropriate) or **IPL** for broader field treatment.  
- If PIH risk is high (darker phototype, prior PIH): consider approaches with lower PIH signals (e.g., picosecond 532 vs QS 532) [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/), or IPL/PDL options summarized as potentially lower PIH in review data [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11948172/).

### If the main issue is **melasma**
- Start with **photoprotection + topical gold standards**; devices only if refractory and with informed consent re: relapse/PIH [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/).
- If proceeding with devices:
  - Consider strategies aimed at **lower inflammation** and **vascular/erythema components** (e.g., specific AOPT IPL modes with mechanistic support; hybrid QS modes) [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/), [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).
  - Expect **multiple sessions**, maintenance, and careful follow-up; durability is limited and relapse is common in longer follow-up studies [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).

### If the main issue is **photoaging with diffuse dyschromia (“brightening”)**
- NAFL (1550/1927; 1440/1927) and fractional picosecond are common workhorses with evidence for multi-domain improvements [[9]](https://journals.lww.com/dermatologicsurgery/fulltext/2025/01000/nonablative_fractional_diode_laser_resurfacing.12.aspx), [[14]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34608097/), [[36]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32285983/).  
- PBM/LED is useful for patients prioritizing **minimal downtime** and home maintenance, with RCT support for wrinkle improvement and satisfaction [[11]](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/02140/clinical_study_to_evaluate_the_efficacy_and_safety.27.aspx), [[38]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167796/).  
- Expect that pigment improvements may **partially rebound** without maintenance/photoprotection (seen with 1927 nm dyspigmentation study) [[35]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36950878/).

---

## 9) Key knowledge gaps and where research is heading
- **Standardized PBM parameters** for pigment indications (melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) remain underdeveloped despite mechanistic rationale and small clinical studies [[23]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11049838/), [[30]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12935).
- **True head-to-head trials (laser vs IPL vs LED)** for melasma and diffuse dyschromia are still relatively sparse in accessible recent evidence; at least one LED vs QS Nd:YAG RCT exists but its results were not accessible in the provided record [[32]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37703182/).
- Better long-term data are needed for melasma to quantify **recurrence** and to compare maintenance strategies across modalities (topicals vs oral agents vs device-based maintenance) [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/), [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323185/), [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).

### Bottom line (evidence-weighted)
- **Solar lentigines**: light/laser therapies are highly effective; modern evidence favors **picosecond 532 nm over Q-switched 532 nm** for better clearance and lower PIH signal in darker phototypes [[34]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992642/), with IPL also effective in many protocols [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11948172/).  
- **Photoaging + “brightening”**: NAFL (especially 1927-containing protocols) and fractional picosecond platforms have strong roles for combined texture + dyschromia improvements; LED/PBM is increasingly validated for wrinkles and maintenance with low downtime [[9]](https://journals.lww.com/dermatologicsurgery/fulltext/2025/01000/nonablative_fractional_diode_laser_resurfacing.12.aspx), [[14]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34608097/), [[11]](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/02140/clinical_study_to_evaluate_the_efficacy_and_safety.27.aspx), [[38]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167796/).  
- **Melasma**: remains primarily a **medical + photoprotection** disease; devices are adjunctive and best reserved for refractory cases due to PIH and relapse risk, with newer IPL pulse strategies and hybrid laser modes attempting to address vascular/inflammatory biology alongside pigment [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996222/), [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12795099/), [[21]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916844/), [[29]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10129-4).

If you tell me your **Fitzpatrick skin type**, whether pigmentation is **spotty vs diffuse**, and whether melasma is **epidermal/dermal/mixed** (if known), I can map these findings into a practical, risk-minimized modality and maintenance plan.
