============================================================

QUESTION:
I would like a detailed analysis of the Saint Seiya franchise (anime/manga). The analysis should be structured around the different classes of armor (Cloths, Scales, Surplices, God Robes, etc.), such as Bronze Saints, Silver Saints, Gold Saints, Marina Generals, Specters, God Warriors, etc. For each significant character within these categories, provide details on their power level, signature techniques, key appearances/story arcs, and final outcome/fate within the series.

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (9 total):
  #1: Research and summarize Saint Seiya franchise continuities/works (original manga, classic anime+OVAs, films, spin-offs like Next Dimension, Lost Canvas, Episode G, Saintia Sho, Omega, Soul of Gold, novels) and propose practical rules for handling canon/contradictions in an armor-based character analysis. Focus on what each continuity covers and major differences impacting character fates/power.
  #2: Build a taxonomy of Saint Seiya armor classes and factions: Cloths (Bronze/Silver/Gold, V1-V5 upgrades, God Cloth/Kamui), Scales, Surplices, God Robes, God Warrior God Robes, other armors (Gladiators, Chronotectors, etc.). Include how they are obtained, powered (Cosmo, Seventh/Eighth Sense, divine blood), repaired/evolved, and notable in-universe mechanics affecting performance.
  #3: Compile key data for Athena’s Saints who wear Cloths (Bronze, Silver, Gold) in the original manga and classic anime/OVAs: significant characters per tier, their power level indicators/feats, signature techniques, key arcs/appearances, and fate/outcome. Note major differences between manga vs anime where relevant.
  #4: Compile key data for Poseidon’s forces (Marinas/Sea Generals and other Mariners) and their Scales in original manga + classic anime: list significant characters (Poseidon/Julian Solo, Sea Generals like Kanon/Dragon, Sorrento, Krishna, Isaac, Baian, Io, Kasa, etc.), their power indicators/feats relative to Bronze/Gold Saints, signature techniques, key appearances in Poseidon arc (and any later Hades appearances/cameos), and their final fate/outcome (death, survival, sealing), noting manga vs anime differences.
  #5: Compile key data for Hades’ forces (Specters) and their Surplices in original manga + Hades OVAs: identify significant characters (Hades/Shun possession, Pandora, Hypnos, Thanatos, Three Judges, major Specters like Myu, Niobe, Valentine, etc., plus resurrected Gold Saints as Specters), with power-scaling notes (Eighth Sense/Underworld rules, castle debuff, Surplice mechanics), signature techniques, key arcs (Sanctuary/Inferno/Elysion), and final fate/outcome, including manga vs anime differences where relevant.
  #6: Research anime-only and other major factions/armors relevant to an armor-class analysis: Asgard God Warriors + God Robes (TV Asgard arc + related film), Soul of Gold developments, Angels/Glories (Heaven Chapter), Eris/Dryads/Leaves (Saintia Sho + Eris film), Omega’s Pallasites/Chronotectors, plus any notable special armors (Athena’s Kamui, God Cloths) as they affect power scaling and character fates. Summarize significant characters per faction, signature techniques, and fate/outcome; also note continuity boundaries.
  #7: Fill gaps for Athena’s Gold Saints and notable Silver Saints in original Saint Seiya manga + classic anime + Hades OVAs: for each of the 12 Gold Saints (Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces) summarize signature techniques, key arcs (Sanctuary, Poseidon minimal, Hades roles), and fate/outcome (dies in Sanctuary, revived by Hades, sacrifice at Wailing Wall, survivors). Also include key Silver Saints beyond Marin/Shaina/Orphee (Misty, Algol, Dante/Capella, etc.) with techniques and fates. Use highest reliability sources available (official guides, encyclopedias, or well-cited references); avoid fan-calcs.
  #8: Fill gaps for Poseidon arc: provide a coherent list of the seven Marina Generals (Sea Dragon Kanon, Siren Sorrento, Kraken Isaac, Chrysaor Krishna, Lyumnades Kasa/Caça, Scylla Io, Sea Horse Baian) and Poseidon/Julian, plus notable Marinas (Thetis). For each, summarize signature techniques, key fights, and definitive fate/outcome in manga and classic anime (and Hades OVA cameo if applicable). Prioritize reliable sources; explicitly note where manga/anime differ.
  #9: Fill gaps for Hades arc antagonists in original manga + Hades OVAs: compile key Specters (Three Judges, Charon, Pharaoh, Sylphid, Gordon, Queen, Zelos, Raimi, Cube, etc.) and gods (Hades, Hypnos, Thanatos, Pandora). For each, summarize techniques, major battles, and definitive fate/outcome. Also clarify Rhadamanthys’ final end in manga/OVAs and any major manga vs anime differences (e.g., Valentine pit change). Prioritize reliable sources over fan-wiki speculation.

============================================================

ANSWER:
### 1) Scope, continuity, and how to handle contradictions (practical rules)

**Core baseline (“Kurumada mainline”)**
- **Original manga (1985–1990)** is the primary baseline: Galaxian Wars → Sanctuary (12 Houses; “Pope” is Gemini Saga) → Poseidon → Hades (Sanctuary/Inferno/Elysion). Ending state: Hades, Hypnos, Thanatos are defeated; **Seiya is left fatally wounded by Hades’ sword** and Athena returns with his body [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya).  
- **Next Dimension (2006–2024)** is explicitly described as **a direct sequel to the original manga** while also functioning as a prequel via time-travel to the 18th century Holy War; it is presented as canonical in Kurumada’s chronology [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension).

**Anime continuity (“Toei classic”)**
- **Classic TV anime (114 eps)** adapts early arcs but includes **anime-original material**; notably, the **Asgard arc** (eps 74–99) is filler created because the anime was catching up to the manga [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya_(TV_series)), [[14]](http://landofobscusion.blogspot.com/2025/03/diagnosis-filler-saint-seiyas-asgard.html).  
- **Hades OVAs (2002–2008)** adapt the manga’s final arcs and serve as a sequel to the classic anime [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_The_Hades_Chapter).

**Major spin-off continuities (treat as separate unless stated)**
- **The Lost Canvas** is an 18th-century Holy War spin-off. It diverged enough from Next Dimension that the planned “multi-angle interpretation” approach was abandoned [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension), [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_The_Lost_Canvas).  
- **Omega** is explicitly an **original anime story** with system changes (ClothStones; elemental Cosmo), separate from Kurumada manga continuity [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya_Omega).  
- **Soul of Gold** is an **original anime story** focusing on resurrected Gold Saints in Asgard [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Soul_of_Gold).  
- **Episode G / Assassin / Requiem** are Okada’s spin-off universes [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya_Episode.G).  
- **Saintia Shō** is a side story set during the classic era, introducing Saintia (female attendants/guards of Athena) [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Saintia_Sh%C5%8D).  
- Films are generally **not canon** to the manga/anime chronology; the franchise has multiple film-only enemies and armor systems [[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saint_Seiya_films). (Film canon-status statements vary by source; treat films as **standalone timelines** unless directly reconciled.)

**Rules used below**
1) **Armor class = structure**; **continuity = variant.** I’ll describe each faction/armor type once (mechanics), then list significant wearers.  
2) If manga vs classic anime differ, I’ll call it out explicitly (e.g., Asgard-only God Warriors; Crystal Saint vs Camus as Hyōga’s master) [[56]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Asgard), [[57]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Saint).  
3) **“Power level”** is expressed mainly via **Sense/Cosmo thresholds** (6th/7th/8th Sense) and explicit in-story comparisons, rather than numeric fan-calcs [[41]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sense), [[75]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_Sense).  
4) If a character’s **fate** is unclear in the provided sources (notably a couple of Poseidon/Hades details), I’ll say so.

## 2) Armor taxonomy & mechanics (what the armors are, how they work)

### A) Cloths (Athena’s Saints)
**What they are**
- Sacred armors tied to constellations; **semi-living** and can act autonomously in extreme cases (e.g., rejecting an unworthy user) [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths).  
- Stored in **Pandora Boxes** [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths).  
- **Rank classes:** Bronze, Silver, Gold, and evolved states such as **God Cloth** [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths).

**How they are powered**
- A Cloth **has no power source on its own**; it’s only effective when the wearer burns **Cosmo** [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths). Without Cosmo, it can even hinder movement [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths).

**Repair / revival / evolution**
- Repaired by Jamir alchemists (e.g., Mu) using specialized knowledge and tools; Cloths can “die” and require blood to revive [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths).  
- **Blood used matters**: after Sanctuary, protagonists’ Bronze Cloths are repaired with **Gold Saints’ blood**, making them stronger; later repaired with **Athena’s blood** before entering the Underworld [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths), [[25]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Cloth).  
- **Goldening mechanic**: if a Bronze Saint raises Cosmo to Gold level (7th Sense), a Gold-blood-repaired Bronze Cloth can glow gold and reach near-Gold effectiveness [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths).  
- **God Cloth**: a peak state associated with **Athena’s blood** and extreme Cosmo (often tied to 8th Sense in Hades/Elysion context) [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths), [[26]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Cloths).

**Power thresholds (Cosmo “Senses”)**
- **7th Sense**: “Miraculosity” enabling miracles such as speed-of-light movement and absolute-zero feats; typically what makes Gold Saints Gold Saints [[41]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sense).  
- **8th Sense (Arayashiki)**: soul-linked awakening needed to resist Underworld domination; critical in Hades arc [[75]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_Sense), [[74]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Underworld).  
- These are the franchise’s most consistent “power level” markers [[41]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sense), [[75]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_Sense).

### B) Gold Cloths (Zodiac)
- **13 total** corresponding to the Zodiac; highest standard Cloth class for Saints [[24]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Cloths).  
- Associated with **speed-of-light** combat via 7th Sense [[24]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Cloths), [[51]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints).  
- Stated to withstand **absolute zero** and enormous energies; destruction typically requires god-level force [[24]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Cloths).  
- When **all 12** gather, they can create “resonance” and collectively reproduce sun-like light for exceptional feats (important for the Wailing Wall) [[51]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints), [[52]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Wailing_Wall).

### C) God Cloths (Athena’s Saints; evolved Cloths)
- Transformed/“reborn” via **Athena’s blood**; depicted as providing power beyond Gold Saints, enabling combat against divine beings like Thanatos/Hypnos [[26]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Cloths).  
- Still mortal-made and can be pierced/destroyed by top-tier divine weapons (e.g., Hades’ sword) [[26]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Cloths).

### D) Kamui (Olympian gods’ sacred armors)
- The highest tier: original divine armors of Olympian gods. Only **Athena’s Cloth/Kamui** is clearly presented as used in battle in the provided materials [[27]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Kamui).  
- Athena’s Cloth can lie dormant as the Athena statue and be restored by Athena’s blood [[27]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Kamui).

---

### E) Scales (Poseidon’s Mariners)
- Mariners wear **Scales**, made with **Orichalcum**, described as Earth’s strongest metal; Scales are stored in object form in Poseidon’s Temple (no Pandora boxes) [[28]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scales).  
- Cloths were created as a countermeasure because Poseidon’s Scales were initially overwhelming [[28]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scales).  
- Scales do **not** show “living” behavior like Cloths (no indication they are alive) [[28]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scales).  
- No clear “evolution” system is provided; they can be repaired (they are later found pristine) [[28]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scales).  
- **Marine Generals** are repeatedly framed as “Gold Saint equivalents” in their tiering language [[66]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Horse_Scale), [[68]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scylla_Scale), [[70]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Chrysaor_Scale).

---

### F) Surplices (Hades’ Specters)
- **Surplices** are the armors of Hades’ **108 Specters** [[30]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Surplices).  
- Allow Specters to travel to the Underworld **without needing to burn Cosmo to 8th Sense levels** [[30]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Surplices).  
- No indication Surplices are alive; durability varies greatly [[30]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Surplices).  
- Resurrected Saints’ Cloths can be **turned into Surplices** [[30]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Surplices).  
- Underworld rule: without 8th Sense or special devices, existence in the Underworld is normally impossible; Specters are exempt partly due to Surplices and Hades’ authority [[74]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Underworld), [[75]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_Sense).

---

### G) God Robes (Asgard God Warriors; anime-only Asgard arc)
- Worn by Asgard’s **God Warriors** in the anime-only Asgard chapter [[31]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Robes), [[56]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Asgard).  
- Awakened by Hilda via Polaris power; each bears an **Odin Sapphire** tied to the Big Dipper; sapphires are used to summon Odin’s Robe and Balmung [[31]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Robes).  
- They are durable—withstanding 7th Sense-level Saint attacks—yet implied below Gold Cloth durability overall [[31]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Robes).

---

### H) Glories (Angels)
- Armor of “Angels” (Olympian enforcers). They wear **Glories** [[34]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Glories), [[104]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Angels).  
- Prominently appear in **Heaven Chapter – Overture** film; Toma later appears in Next Dimension in a different form [[104]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Angels), [[105]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Heaven_Chapter:_Overture).

---

### I) Leaves (Eris’ Dryads)
- In **Saintia Shō**, Eris’ warriors are **Dryads** wearing **Leaves** (“Evil Spirit Mantle”) [[35]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eris_(Saintia_Sh%C5%8D)).  
- Also includes “Ghosts” (dead Saints revived via Evil Seeds) [[35]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eris_(Saintia_Sh%C5%8D)).

---

### J) Chronotectors (Omega Pallasites)
- In Omega, Pallasites wear **Chronotectors** [[32]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Chronotectors), [[33]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pallasites).  
- The provided sources give little mechanical detail beyond rank/class system and faction structure [[33]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pallasites).

### 3.3 Gold Saints (Gold Cloths; Zodiac)

**Gold Saints as a class**
- Elite guardians of the Twelve Houses; typically 7th Sense users (speed-of-light tier) [[51]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints), [[41]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sense).  
- Three Gold Saints can use **Athena Exclamation**, described as Big Bang-like and forbidden [[51]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints).  
- In Hades arc, the **Wailing Wall** requires sun-like power to destroy; Libra weapons cannot scratch it; it is destroyed by the collective Cosmo of the Gold Saints in the twentieth-century Holy War [[52]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Wailing_Wall).

Below: each Gold Saint with (a) techniques, (b) key arcs, (c) fate/outcome. Where the dataset provides firm statements, I cite them; where the dataset is thin, I stick to higher-level confirmed arc outcomes.

(Mu’s individual death moment is not singled out in the Toei excerpts provided; the Wailing Wall outcome is the clearest cited end-state [[52]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Wailing_Wall).)

---

  - Hades arc contains revived Gold Saints as a major plot device (Toei summary), but the dataset doesn’t provide an official Toei line itemizing Saga’s revived-state fate; arc-level resolution proceeds toward Underworld [[119]](http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/sp/seiya_zenshou/).

---

#### Cancer Deathmask — Cancer Gold Cloth
- **Signature technique (Toei)**: **Sekishiki Meikai Ha** (sends souls to Underworld) [[123]](https://www.toei-anim.co.jp/sp/seiya_koushou/character/gold-44.html).

  - (If you want, I can provide a “classic technique set” appendix for every Gold Saint using the compilation lists, clearly labeled as secondary.)

---

- **Special system**
  - **Misopethamenos** seals his true form; Libra Cloth has **six weapons** with star-shattering power (as stated) [[126]](https://www.toei-anim.co.jp/sp/seiya_koushou/character/gold-47.html).  
- **Fate/outcome**

---

  - Dead prior to main story; persists via soul in Cloth and repeated interventions [[128]](https://www.toei-anim.co.jp/sp/seiya_koushou/character/gold-49.html).  
- **Technique naming nuance**
  - “Atomic Thunderbolt” is sometimes listed for him but is described as anime-original in one technique database [[120]](https://www8.big.or.jp/~gaterar/saint/blowdex.html); treat it as **anime-only attribution** unless you confirm it in the manga/anime episode.

---

- **Fate/outcome**
  - Not explicitly stated in Toei excerpts; broader Hades narrative includes revived Gold Saints and Underworld conflicts [[119]](http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/sp/seiya_zenshou/).

---

#### Pisces Aphrodite — Pisces Gold Cloth

## 4) Poseidon faction (Scales) — Marines, Sea Generals, and Poseidon himself

### 4.1 Scale mechanics recap (battle implications)
- Scales are Orichalcum-based and were historically strong enough that Athena’s side needed Cloths as a countermeasure [[28]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scales).  
- Marine Generals are repeatedly framed as **Gold-equivalent** opponents [[66]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Horse_Scale), [[68]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scylla_Scale), [[70]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Chrysaor_Scale).  
- Poseidon’s personal Scale shows exceptional resistance (arrow feat described in armor page summary) [[29]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Poseidon_Scale).

### 4.2 Poseidon / Julian Solo — Poseidon Scale
- **Role**
  - Julian Solo is the chosen host of Poseidon (Solo bloodline) [[61]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Julian_Solo).  
  - Kanon triggers Poseidon’s awakening and guides the plan to wait until Julian is 16 [[62]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Dragon_Kanon).  
- **Key arc**
  - Poseidon arc centers on flooding the Earth; Athena is imprisoned; Saints must destroy the seven ocean pillars guarded by seven Generals (explained by Thetis) [[73]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Mermaid_Thetis).  
- **Outcome**

  - Later Hades/Elysion narrative summaries claim Poseidon briefly awakens (still sealed) and sends Gold Cloths to Elysion, after which Thanatos destroys them [[86]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Thanatos). (This is a major cross-faction interaction: Poseidon aids Athena’s Saints indirectly, but his sent Cloths are destroyed by Thanatos.)

### 4.3 The Seven Marina Generals (each guards a Mammoth Pillar)

#### Sea Horse Baian — Sea Horse Scale (North Pacific Pillar)
- **Power indicator**

---

---

#### Siren Sorrento — Siren Scale (South Atlantic Pillar)
- **Power indicator**

- **Signature techniques**
  - **Dead End Symphony** (cripples mind/Cosmo) [[65]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Siren_Sorrento).

---

#### Kraken Isaac — Kraken Scale (Arctic Pillar)

- **Signature technique**
  - **Aurora Borealis** [[71]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Kraken_Isaak).  
- **Key fights**
  - Confronts Hyōga at Arctic pillar; major emotional rival [[71]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Kraken_Isaak).  
- **Fate/outcome**

---

## 5) Hades faction (Surplices) — Specters, Underworld rules, and divine antagonists

### 5.1 Underworld mechanics that directly affect “power levels”
- **Surplices bypass** the need to burn Cosmo to Eighth Sense levels for Underworld travel [[30]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Surplices).  
- In the Underworld, “no life is possible” without **Eighth Sense or special devices**, because all things fall under Hades’ control; Specters are exempt because they wear Surplices and have Hades’ permission [[74]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Underworld), [[75]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_Sense).  
- Hades’ castle environment can impose a **power reduction to 1/10** on Saints (as described in the Milo narrative summary), enabling Rhadamanthys to overwhelm multiple Gold Saints there [[87]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scorpio_Milo).

These mechanics explain why some matchups look “inconsistent” unless you account for realm rules and debuffs.

---

### 5.2 Hades (god) — Hades Surplice (divine Surplice)
- **Role**
  - King of the Underworld; reborn every 243 years to wage war on Athena (as summarized) [[83]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Hades).  
  - Uses human hosts (including Shun) while true body sleeps in Elysion [[83]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Hades).  
- **Key arcs**
  - Hades Sanctuary/Inferno/Elysion: revives Specters, manipulates conflicts; climax in Elysion [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya), [[83]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Hades).  
- **Fate/outcome**
  - Defeated in Elysion; Underworld collapses/vanishes after his defeat in the narrative summaries [[85]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Hypnos).  
  - Seiya is left cursed/wounded by Hades’ sword in the original ending state [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya).

---

- **Fate/outcome**
  - **Killed by Thanatos** for “betrayal”; dies in Ikki’s arms [[84]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pandora).

---

### 5.4 Hypnos & Thanatos (divine twins; Surplices soaked in divine blood)

## 6) Asgard (God Robes) — classic anime-only God Warriors + Soul of Gold extension

### 6.1 Classic TV Asgard God Warriors (anime-only continuity)
**Armor/mechanics recap**
- God Robes awakened by Hilda (controlled by Poseidon) through Polaris; each has an Odin Sapphire; sapphires are used to summon Odin’s Robe and Balmung [[31]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Robes).  
- Asgard arc exists only in anime continuity and is filler relative to manga [[56]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Asgard), [[14]](http://landofobscusion.blogspot.com/2025/03/diagnosis-filler-saint-seiyas-asgard.html).

### 6.2 Soul of Gold (anime sequel-side story)
- Premise: Gold Saints resurrect in Asgard after their Hades-era sacrifice and confront a new Yggdrasil crisis [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Soul_of_Gold), [[102]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gold_Legend_Revived!).  
- Key system change: Gold Cloths can awaken into **God Cloth states** within this continuity [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Soul_of_Gold), [[102]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gold_Legend_Revived!).  
- Antagonists: Andreas Lise and “false god” Loki (possession/true mastermind) [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Soul_of_Gold).  
- New God Warriors appear (Fafner, Heracles, Surtr, Sigmund, Baldr, Útgarðar, Fródi) with varied outcomes (e.g., Fafner trapped in Yomotsu Hirasaka; Baldr dies in peace; Surtr killed by Camus; etc.) [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Soul_of_Gold).  
- **Continuity note:** Soul of Gold is explicitly an original anime story; treat as anime-continuity expansion rather than manga-canon [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Soul_of_Gold).

## 7) Angels (Glories) — Heaven Chapter film + Next Dimension echo

### Angels & Glories (armor class)
- Angels wear **Glories** [[34]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Glories), [[104]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Angels).  
- In Heaven Chapter – Overture, Angels are described as extremely powerful enemies whose battles heavily damage the protagonists’ top-tier Cloths [[104]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Angels), [[105]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Heaven_Chapter:_Overture).

### Heaven Chapter – Overture (film continuity)
- Plot premise: Artemis replaces Athena as Earth’s guardian and takes over Sanctuary; Bronzes fight Angels and Artemis’ control to rescue Athena [[105]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Heaven_Chapter:_Overture).  
- Significant Angels named: **Toma (Icarus)**, **Theseus**, **Odysseus** [[104]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Angels).

#### Icarus Toma — Icarus Glory (film); later Sleep Angel Glory (Next Dimension)
- Film arc: fights Seiya; revealed as Marin’s brother via pendant; Seiya defeats him after breaking free of Hades’ curse state (as described) [[107]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Icarus_Toma).  
- Next Dimension: appears again as a prisoner freed under Artemis’ orders; wears a different Glory (Sleep Angel) and is masked/subjugated (as summarized) [[104]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Angels), [[107]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Icarus_Toma).  
- Continuity note: this is one of the clearest examples of a film concept being partially re-integrated differently into Kurumada’s later manga [[104]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Angels).

#### Theseus — Glory
- Summary states he fights Ikki/Shun and is defeated at great cost (description is rough and likely paraphrased) [[106]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Theseus).  
- Treat this as film-only outcome unless verified.

---

## 8) Eris (Leaves) — film vs Saintia Shō

### Eris in films (separate continuity)
- Eris appears as a film antagonist who kidnaps Athena; her forces include the **Ghost Five** (resurrected Saints) [[108]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eris), [[109]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost_Five).  
- Film continuity is generally treated as standalone relative to manga [[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saint_Seiya_films).

### Eris in Saintia Shō (side story)
- Eris’ warriors are **Dryads** wearing **Leaves**; also “Ghosts” revived via Evil Seeds from the Tree Uterus [[35]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eris_(Saintia_Sh%C5%8D)).  
- Dryad roster includes entities like **Madness Mania**, **Murder Phonos**, **Ruin Atë**, etc. [[110]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Dryades).  
- Canon handling note from a canon discussion: Saintia Shō uses Eris as antagonist inspired by the movie but “pretends the movie never happened,” while being supervised by Kurumada per that summary [[111]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Canon_%26_Non_Canon). Treat Saintia Shō as a parallel side story during the classic timeframe [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Saintia_Sh%C5%8D), [[111]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Canon_%26_Non_Canon).

---

## 9) Omega (Chronotectors) — Pallasites (separate anime continuity)

- Omega is an original anime continuity 25 years after the classic wars, with different Cloth system (ClothStones) and elemental Cosmo [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya_Omega).  
- Pallasites wear **Chronotectors** [[32]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Chronotectors), [[33]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pallasites).  
- Hierarchy: 3rd/2nd/1st class; 1st class (“Four Heavenly Kings”) are top-tier, with Chronotector said to be equal to “three Zodiac constellations” (as described) [[113]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pallasites_First_Class).  
- True mastermind is **Saturn** (in human form Subaru), manipulating Pallasites [[33]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pallasites), [[113]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pallasites_First_Class).

Because your request focuses on armor-class structure and “significant characters,” here are the main Omega Chronotector bearers called out in the dataset:
- **Pallas** (goddess figure used as pawn) [[112]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pallas_(Omega)).  
- **1st Class**: Titan, Hyperion, Gallia, Aegaeon, Europe, Mira (lists vary; internal inconsistency exists across pages) [[113]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pallasites_First_Class), [[114]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pallasites_Second_Class).  
- **2nd Class example with details**: **Dione** attempts to kill Aries Kiki to prevent Cloth repairs; is repelled by Starlight Extinction in the summary [[115]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Whip_Dione).

(If you want, I can expand Omega into a full character-by-character list, but the provided sources here are thinner on techniques/fates than for classic manga/anime factions.)

---

## 10) “Other” notable armor systems / factions

### Adamas (Giants; Gigantomachia novel continuity)
- Giants wear **Adamas**, crystalline armor that allows resisting Typhon’s life-draining field around Mount Etna/Arima [[36]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/GIANTS_(gigas)).  
- Gigantomachia is a novel duology introducing Giants and nonstandard Cloth ranks (e.g., Coma Cloth) [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Gigantomachia), [[36]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/GIANTS_(gigas)). Treat as a separate continuity branch.

### Gladiators (Episode G Assassin)
- Gladiators are sword-wielding warriors in Episode G Assassin; defined by Sacred Swords and **Holy Sword Embodiment**, not a clearly distinct armor class in the provided excerpt [[37]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gladiators).  
- Treat as a faction whose “equipment identity” is weapon-centric rather than armor-centric in the retrieved dataset [[37]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gladiators).

---

# 11) Cross-faction “power level” framework (keeps the analysis consistent)

### A) What matters most (and is repeatedly supported)
1) **Cosmo/Sense tier** (7th vs 8th) is the central universal scaler across factions [[41]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sense), [[75]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eighth_Sense).  
2) **Realm rules** (Underworld suppression; special devices; Surplice travel advantage) fundamentally affect who can fight effectively where [[74]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Underworld), [[30]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Surplices).  
3) **Armor state** (standard Cloth vs Gold-blood upgraded vs Athena-blood “final” vs God Cloth) is a major multiplier on protagonist performance [[23]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Cloths), [[25]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Cloth), [[26]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Cloths).  
4) **Divine vs mortal-made**: Kamui > God Cloth > Gold Cloth > Silver > Bronze is the general intended hierarchy, with exceptions when Cosmo spikes or when a god’s domain imposes debuffs [[27]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Kamui), [[26]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Cloths), [[24]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Cloths), [[87]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scorpio_Milo).

### B) Practical matchup assumptions (supported by citations above)
- **Marine Generals ≈ Gold Saint tier** is explicitly stated repeatedly in the Poseidon-arc summaries (e.g., Baian comparison) and Scale templates [[64]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Horse_Baian), [[66]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Horse_Scale).  
- **Judges** are generally above ordinary Specters; their unique techniques (Cosmic Marionettion; Galactica Illusion; domain advantages) allow them to dominate many Saints unless countered by 8th Sense or situational advantages [[80]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Griffon_Minos), [[81]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Garuda_Aiacos), [[87]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scorpio_Milo).  
- **Divine Twins (Hypnos/Thanatos)** sit above Gold Saints in Elysion contexts, as shown by their destruction of Gold Cloths and dominance until God Cloth awakenings occur [[86]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Thanatos), [[85]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Hypnos).

---

## 12) What you may want next (to make this “complete-complete”)
Your prompt asked for “each significant character” across many categories with techniques, arcs, and final fate. With the dataset provided, the **most complete** coverage is for:
- Poseidon Generals (except Isaac’s final resolution is truncated) [[64]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Horse_Baian), [[67]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Scylla_Io), [[69]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Chrysaor_Krishna), [[72]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Lyumnades_Ca%C3%A7a), [[65]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Siren_Sorrento), [[71]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Kraken_Isaak).  
- Many key Hades Specters (Charon, Pharaoh, Valentine, Myu, Niobe, Raimi, Zelos, Sylphid/Gordon/Queen, Minos, Aiacos) [[142]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Acheron_Charon), [[143]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sphinx_Pharaoh), [[79]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Harpy_Valentine), [[77]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Papillon_Myu), [[78]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_Niobe), [[148]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Worm_Raimi), [[147]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Frog_Zelos), [[144]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Basilisk_Sylphid), [[145]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Minotauros_Gordon), [[146]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Alraune_Queen), [[80]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Griffon_Minos), [[81]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Garuda_Aiacos).  
- Asgard God Warriors (full set; anime-only) [[93]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Dubhe_Alpha_Siegfried)–[[100]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Alcor_Zeta_Bud), with armor mechanics [[31]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/God_Robes).

The **thinnest** area in the provided sources is **a fully authoritative, individually cited fate outcome for each of the 12 Gold Saints across Sanctuary → Hades**, using primary/official references. We do have Toei-confirmed outcomes for Saga (suicide) and that Aldebaran and Shaka die in the Hades Sanctuary-phase [[122]](https://www.toei-anim.co.jp/sp/seiya_koushou/character/gold-43.html), [[119]](http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/sp/seiya_zenshou/), plus broad arc-level mechanisms (Wailing Wall destruction requires Gold Cosmo) [[52]](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Wailing_Wall). But if you want truly definitive per-Gold-Saint end states (who exactly dies when, who revives as what, etc.) with maximum rigor, the next step would be to anchor each one to specific manga chapters/OVA episodes or an official databook excerpt (e.g., Taizen), which was not fully available in the retrieved sources [[119]](http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/sp/seiya_zenshou/), [[138]](https://www.scribd.com/document/913356015/Taizen-Saint-Seiya-Convert-Compress).

If you want, I can produce **a second-pass appendix** that:
- lists **every named technique** for each Gold Saint from the compiled lists, clearly tagged as “secondary compilation,”  
- and builds a **per-arc death/return timeline** with “certainty levels” (Toei-confirmed vs multi-source summary vs missing).
