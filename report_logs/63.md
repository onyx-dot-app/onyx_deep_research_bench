ANSWER:
Plasma etching can “damage” LN in several distinct ways, and the right mitigation depends on **which damage channel is dominating your device metric** (loss/Q vs χ(2)/EO stability vs poling/domain integrity). Below is a practical, research-backed menu of mitigation options, organized by *mechanism* and *when/where* to apply them (during etch, immediately after etch, and post-repair), with the key tradeoffs called out.

---

## 1) What “damage” you’re likely seeing after LN plasma etch (and why it matters)

### A. **Non‑volatile byproducts + redeposition → micromasking → sidewall roughness → scattering loss**
This is the dominant limiter for many LNOI waveguides/resonators: **sidewall-roughness scattering** is repeatedly identified as the major loss mechanism in etched LN PICs [[1]](http://ciqm.harvard.edu/uploads/2/3/3/4/23349210/zhu2021.pdf), and Ar sputter etches are explicitly linked to micromasking from redeposited material on etched walls [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11501321/).

- **Fluorine chemistries (CHF₃/CF₄/SF₆)**: form **LiF**, which is non‑volatile and accumulates on sidewalls, worsening roughness and sidewall angle [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/), and has been directly observed as an amorphous precipitate layer after CHF₃ plasma with roughness exploding from ~2 nm to ~43 nm peak‑to‑peak (bulk LN test) [[5]](https://www.soc.co.jp/sys/wp-content/themes/soc/assets/pdf/development/technology/document/surface.pdf).  
- **Ar physical sputter etch**: avoids LiF chemistry but still redeposits sputtered LN species, producing “fences”/sidewall buildup and micromasking unless you tune toward a redeposition‑free regime [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11501321/), [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).

**Impact:** higher propagation loss, reduced resonator Q, poorer yield.

### B. **Near‑surface chemical modification / defect creation (oxygen vacancies, altered stoichiometry) → absorption, drift, photorefraction changes**
Some post-etch cleans (notably SC‑1) were shown to remove an **oxygen-vacancy-rich surface layer** on LNOI [[21]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396345136_Thin_film_LiNbO3_surface_preparation_using_SC-1), implying such layers can exist and be modified by processing. Oxygen-plasma treatments measurably change LN surface composition (XPS/Raman/IR evidence of altered Nb:O surface ratio) [[23]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pssa.202400924).  

**Impact:** can show up as excess absorption (material loss), long-term drift, and stability changes. (The provided sources emphasize loss/Q more than direct χ(2)/EO-coefficient change measurements from plasma damage; treat χ(2)/EO degradation from etch as plausible but not well-quantified in this specific evidence set.)

### C. **Ion-induced lattice damage / amorphization (plus ion-slicing damage in LNOI) → absorption-limited loss**
Even if your etch is “clean,” LNOI films often carry implantation-related damage from ion slicing; **annealing in O₂** can dramatically reduce absorption-limited loss and boost Q [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate). For nonlinear photonics, this matters because absorption directly heats devices and destabilizes phase matching.

**Impact:** material absorption component of loss; thermal instabilities; reduced high-power handling.

---

## 2) Mitigation during plasma etch (best ROI: prevent damage rather than “fix” it)

### 2.1 Choose chemistry to avoid “hard” residues (LiF) when possible
**If you can choose chemistry/tooling:**

- **Prefer Cl-based ICP (e.g., Ar/Cl₂/BCl₃) for better byproduct volatility.** Reviews summarize that chlorine chemistries form LiCl (more removable) and tend to produce better morphology than fluorine chemistries that form LiF [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/).  
  *Tradeoff:* lower etch rates and stricter equipment constraints are commonly noted [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/).

- **If using F-based plasmas (CHF₃, SF₆)**, assume LiF-related micromasking is your main enemy and plan for it (in-etch knobs + post-etch removal).

### 2.2 Control ion energy and angular distribution (pressure + bias are the critical knobs)
For **Ar sputter ICP etching**, the most detailed “damage minimization” guidance in the sources is essentially: tune toward a **redeposition-free regime** by balancing **DC bias** and **pressure** [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11501321/).

- Increasing DC bias reduced redeposition in one systematic sweep (100→800 V) but increased trenching per depth (ion deflection damage) [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11501321/).  
  **Practical takeaway:** don’t just maximize bias; find the minimum bias that clears redeposition while not inducing edge trenching/pitting.

A separate Ar ICP-RIE optimization study (different tool/conditions) observed:
- At low RF power, redeposition coats sidewalls; by ~300 W RF redeposition on sidewalls can be eliminated during etch, but higher RF can transfer fence roughness into the LN sidewall and induce trench/pit damage [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).  
  They concluded an “optimum” RF window existed (tool-specific) around 100–200 W in their setup [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).

**Actionable process philosophy (tool-agnostic):**
- Use a **two-regime etch** approach when possible:
  1) **Bulk removal** at conditions that etch efficiently but don’t catastrophically redeposit.
  2) **Finish/pass** at reduced ion energy (lower bias) to reduce trenching/knock-on damage—*but only if redeposition doesn’t reappear*.
  
(Your exact window is tool-, depth-, and mask-dependent; the cited works show these regimes exist but don’t provide a universal recipe.)

### 2.3 Temperature management: avoid thermal damage, but use temperature strategically for volatility
Two competing realities:

1) **LN is susceptible to thermal gradients and overheating during long etches**, motivating **segmented etches with cooldown pauses**. One Ar etch waveguide workflow used repeated **1-minute etch steps separated by ~5 minutes cooldown** to mitigate overheating damage [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).

2) **Higher substrate temperature can improve chemical etch efficiency and reduce roughness in some chemistries** by promoting volatility/removal of products. In SF₆/O₂ ICP etching, raising substrate temperature strongly increased etch rate; oxygen addition produced much lower RMS roughness than SF₆/Ar at the same temperature (example at 598 K: 30.5 nm vs 119.4 nm RMS) [[12]](https://cns1.rc.fas.harvard.edu/facilities/docs/The%20effect%20of%20a%20lithium%20niobate%20heating%20on%20the%20etching%20rate%20in%20SF6%20ICP%20plasma.pdf).  
   *But* at higher temperatures, LiF redeposition can still become limiting (etch rate saturates) [[12]](https://cns1.rc.fas.harvard.edu/facilities/docs/The%20effect%20of%20a%20lithium%20niobate%20heating%20on%20the%20etching%20rate%20in%20SF6%20ICP%20plasma.pdf).

**Practical takeaway:**  
- For **deep reactive etches**, consider **controlled heating** *plus* a plan to manage LiF (see next section).  
- For **precision photonics etches**, prioritize **thermal stability** and repeatability; use He backside cooling and/or segmented etches to prevent local hot spots (and mask failure).

### 2.4 In-etch “byproduct management”: periodic micro-cleans (hybrid cycles)
A demonstrated approach for F-based deep etching is to **interrupt etching and chemically remove LiF/byproducts periodically**:

- In heated SF₆/O₂ ICP deep etching, **HF dips** were used (e.g., 30 s after each 90 min) during a long etch to reduce the influence of nonvolatile LiF [[12]](https://cns1.rc.fas.harvard.edu/facilities/docs/The%20effect%20of%20a%20lithium%20niobate%20heating%20on%20the%20etching%20rate%20in%20SF6%20ICP%20plasma.pdf).
- A deep-etch methodology reported **periodically pausing etching and chemically cleaning between cycles** to mitigate thermal effects and byproduct redeposition, enabling deep (~3.4 µm) etches with very vertical facets across orientations (with a Ti/Al/Cr mask stack) [[16]](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836).

**Tradeoff:** every interruption increases process complexity and can introduce variability/geometry change if the wet step attacks LN non-uniformly (especially critical for PPLN—see §4.3).

### 2.5 Geometry/layout tricks to reduce redeposition damage
For Ar sputter etching, three practical strategies were proposed and experimentally explored to reduce redeposition without wet cleaning:
- Tune DC bias/pressure to a redeposition-free regime
- Add nearby “helper” features so ion deflection increases lateral removal of redeposits
- Use a **trapezoidal mask profile** to favor redeposition removal [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11501321/)

These are surprisingly effective knobs when you’re stuck with a given tool chemistry.

---

## 3) Mask + pattern-transfer strategies that reduce etch-induced damage transfer

### 3.1 Use masks that don’t “print” roughness into the LN
Mask roughness often becomes sidewall roughness.

- **Soft resist masks** can degrade during ICP-RIE and transfer line-edge roughness as persistent sidewall striations [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).
- **Cr masks** can improve profiles vs soft masks, but Cr is polycrystalline; grain structure can imprint “granular” sidewall texture (one study measured ~55 nm Cr grain size under a specific deposition condition) [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/). Metallic masks can also be associated with optically absorbent redeposited products in some contexts [[7]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40502-8).
- **SiO₂ masks** are amorphous in principle (good), but can produce charging-induced trenching/pitting because both SiO₂ and LN are insulating; trenching was observed under identical etch conditions where Cr didn’t trench [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).

**Mitigation knobs:**
- Optimize Cr deposition to reduce grain size (process-specific).
- If you must use SiO₂, you may need anti-charging strategies and/or modified plasma parameters (bias/pressure) to reduce ion deflection damage [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).

### 3.2 High-performance hard masks: DLC as a standout option
A major 2023 result: **diamond-like carbon (DLC) hard masks** enable deeply etched, steep-walled strip waveguides with very low propagation loss.

- DLC hard-mask + Ar ion-beam etch achieved ~80° sidewalls and **<4 dB/m** loss in fully etched LN strip waveguides [[7]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40502-8).  
- Rationale: DLC has low sputter yield and good stability, limiting mask erosion that otherwise drives roughness and slanted sidewalls [[7]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40502-8).

If your “damage” is really “roughness from mask erosion + redeposition,” DLC is one of the strongest demonstrated fixes.

### 3.3 Mask stacks for long etches (durability + fewer fence defects)
For long/deep etches, a **Ti/Al/Cr stack** was reported to work well as a hard mask, combined with pause-and-clean cycling to control thermal effects and redeposition [[16]](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836).  
This is especially relevant if your etch depth is >~1 µm and mask survival is a limiting factor.

### 3.4 Improving resist selectivity (when you need small features)
If you rely on HSQ (common for small photonic features), a 2025 report showed **thermal annealing of HSQ masks** improved LN/HSQ selectivity from 0.55 to ~1, while microring Q-based optical losses were reported as unchanged [[34]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41259817/).  
This is not “material repair,” but it prevents process-induced roughness by enabling more faithful pattern transfer.

---

## 4) Post-etch removal/repair (what actually works, and the hidden traps)

### 4.1 Thermal annealing (the most universal “material repair” lever)
Annealing is repeatedly shown to improve Q/loss by repairing damage (often discussed as ion-slicing damage, but also consistent with healing near-surface disorder).

**Two widely used windows with direct device evidence:**
- **O₂ anneal ~520 °C for 2 h at atmospheric pressure**: used to improve crystallinity and reduce waveguide loss [[19]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.09208v1), and in a detailed loss/Q study it increased mean intrinsic Q and reduced absorption-limited loss dramatically; best material-limited performance approached **Q ≈ 1.6×10⁸** and ~0.2 dB/m propagation loss after O₂ anneal in that work [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate).  
- **Air anneal ~450 °C for 2 h**: improved loaded Q of thin-film LN microrings by ~4–5× (e.g., 1.0×10⁶ → 4.3×10⁶) in one report, attributed to lattice damage recovery [[20]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10504).

**Practical guidance:**
- If your application is nonlinear (SHG/OPO), annealing helps by reducing absorption (less thermal detuning) and improving stability.
- If you later deposit cladding, note that one study emphasized low-temperature cladding deposition to preserve anneal benefits, with a re-anneal after cladding in some flows [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate).

### 4.2 Post-etch sidewall smoothing without geometry destruction
**Chemo-mechanical / polishing approaches**
- Dedicated sidewall polishing (with top surface protected) reduced scattering loss by >10× and achieved **down to 0.04 dB/cm** loss in ridge waveguides [[24]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326598284_Scattering-loss_reduction_of_ridge_waveguides_by_sidewall_polishing).  
  *Tradeoff:* polishing can change geometry and sidewall angle; it may be incompatible with very tight confinement or dense layouts.

**Atomic layer etching (ALE) as a smoothing step**
- An isotropic ALE process (H₂ + SF₆/Ar cycling) was reported to reduce sidewall roughness of Ar-milled LN waveguides by **~30% without additional wet processing** [[9]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10592).  
  This is attractive when you want smoothing but must avoid aggressive wet steps (especially for PPLN).

A separate newer ALE direction used heavier halogen chemistry (HBr-based ALE) and reported atomically smooth surfaces after cycling at elevated temperature in that study’s context [[4]](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.01825v1)—promising for “minimal damage” etch paradigms, though it’s not yet the mainstream photonic foundry flow.

### 4.3 Wet chemical cleans: effective for residue removal, but can become the *damage source*
Wet steps are often necessary to remove redeposited material, but they can also:
- chip/peel waveguides,
- alter sidewall angles,
- thin LN films,
- and in periodically poled LN, imprint domain-dependent corrugations.

**Documented behaviors:**
- RCA-1 style cleaning was optimized in one flow to remove redeposition fences, but excessive cleaning caused chipping/peeling and geometry changes; a 24-hour over-clean caused asymmetry and film thinning (≈700 nm → ≈630 nm) [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).
- “HF dip + RCA clean” is described as a typical way to remove redeposited LN after Ar+ milling, **but** wet processing can introduce micron-scale corrugations in PPLN due to differential etch rates between domains, creating dominating optical loss and limiting Q [[22]](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.10592v2).

**SC‑1 (NH₄OH/H₂O₂/H₂O) specifics**
- SC‑1 removes a surface layer with higher oxygen-vacancy content on LNOI [[21]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396345136_Thin_film_LiNbO3_surface_preparation_using_SC-1). This can be good (removing a defective layer), but it also accelerated under-etching beneath Si₃N₄ caps and contributed to pattern delamination for sub-micron features [[21]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396345136_Thin_film_LiNbO3_surface_preparation_using_SC-1).

**Practical rules of thumb:**
- Use the **minimum effective clean time**; validate geometry before/after with SEM/FIB or profilometry.
- For **PPLN nonlinear devices**, be extremely cautious with any wet etch/clean that attacks LN; consider avoiding wet steps by preventing redeposition during etch [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11501321/) or using ALE smoothing [[9]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10592).

### 4.4 Oxygen plasma / re-oxidation surface treatments (useful, but sequence matters)
Oxygen plasma surface activation measurably changes LN surface chemistry (XPS/Raman/IR evidence) [[23]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pssa.202400924). It can be a way to:
- remove organics,
- re-oxidize/re-balance surface chemistry,
- improve downstream process behavior.

But note: in one measurement sequence, O₂ plasma alone increased RMS roughness slightly, while O₂ plasma followed by SC‑1 reduced it below the virgin surface [[21]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396345136_Thin_film_LiNbO3_surface_preparation_using_SC-1). So treat oxygen plasma as a **sequence-dependent** tool, not automatically a “smoother.”

### 4.5 Cladding/passivation after repair
A common flow is:
1) etch → 2) O₂ anneal → 3) oxide cladding (e.g., PECVD SiO₂) for protection and optical mode control [[19]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.09208v1).  
One detailed loss study emphasized that **low-temperature cladding deposition** can help preserve anneal benefits, and sometimes a post-clad re-anneal is used [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate).

---

## 5) Damage-mitigation “by design” (reduce sensitivity to etched LN damage in nonlinear photonics)

These approaches can be more powerful than incremental process tweaks if your limiting factor is sidewall scattering or if your device is extremely sensitive (high-Q SHG, OPO thresholds, etc.):

### 5.1 Shallow-etch / reduced sidewall overlap
Shallow etches reduce the optical field intensity at etched walls → lower scattering sensitivity. This is explicitly motivated as a way to reduce scattering loss from rough sidewalls in Ar-etched LN [[40]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/13/3/035332/2881553/Shallow-etched-low-loss-thin-film-lithium-niobate).  
Tradeoff: shallow etches can leak into slab modes unless carefully designed (e.g., BIC concepts) [[40]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/13/3/035332/2881553/Shallow-etched-low-loss-thin-film-lithium-niobate).

### 5.2 Etchless / polymer-loaded BIC waveguides
An “etchless” periodically poled thin-film LN waveguide loaded with polymer cladding was demonstrated, reporting high normalized SHG efficiency and simulated low propagation loss while avoiding complex etching [[41]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40984243/).  
Tradeoff: polymer stability/absorption window considerations may apply depending on environment and wavelength.

### 5.3 Heterogeneous platforms: put the “hard waveguide” in Si₃N₄, bond LN for χ(2)/EO
Wafer-scale LN-on-Si₃N₄ integration is explicitly motivated by avoiding non-conventional LN etching and improving manufacturability, while still accessing EO/nonlinear properties via mode participation in LN [[43]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10264395/), [[42]](https://siliconphotonics.ece.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2017-06/chang17ol.pdf).  
Tradeoff: increasing LN confinement improves modulation/nonlinear strength but can increase optical losses in some geometries [[43]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10264395/).

### 5.4 Crystal orientation awareness (especially when wet steps are involved)
LN etch rates depend strongly on crystal face/orientation in wet chemistry [[45]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21041126/), and one practical study attributed asymmetric geometry after over-cleaning to differential etching of different LN crystal surfaces [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).  
So: if your post-etch clean is unavoidable, orientation choice (and ensuring symmetric exposure of equivalent facets) can reduce geometry drift.

---

## 6) How to *tell* whether you fixed “material damage” (metrology that maps to the mechanisms)

Because “damage” can mean chemistry, structure, roughness, or absorption, you need a minimal diagnostic stack:

### A. Roughness / morphology (scattering pathway)
- AFM on top surfaces (baseline smoothness and post-step changes)  
- SEM/FIB cross-sections for sidewall fences/redeposit layers (redep vs true sidewall) [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/)  
- Resonator Q statistics (many resonances, not one) to detect scattering-limited behavior [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate)

### B. Surface chemistry / stoichiometry (LiF, oxygen-vacancy layers, contamination)
- XPS / angle-resolved XPS: strong for nm-scale surface modifications; oxygen plasma activation showed measurable composition change by XPS [[23]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pssa.202400924)  
- SIMS/ToF-SIMS depth profiling (especially if you suspect F penetration / LiF layer; classic CHF₃ study saw fluorination signatures persisting ~tens of nm depth scale) [[5]](https://www.soc.co.jp/sys/wp-content/themes/soc/assets/pdf/development/technology/document/surface.pdf)

### C. Absorption vs scattering separation (critical for nonlinear photonics)
One advanced approach explicitly separates absorption and scattering contributions using resonator pump–probe/Kerr-calibrated linear response methods [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate). This is valuable because annealing can reduce absorption-limited loss even when sidewall scattering remains.

### D. Process-control mindset
The IRDS metrology roadmap emphasizes that **nm-thin sidewall damage layers** from plasma processes are hard to quantify and require correlated metrology + standards development, highlighting angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, TEM/STEM(+EELS), SIMS/ToF-SIMS, GI-XRR, GI-XRD as complementary tools [[51]](https://irds.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/2023/2023IRDS_MET.pdf).

## 7) A practical “playbook” (putting it together)

If your current symptom is **high loss / low Q after etch**:

1) **First determine if it’s redeposition/roughness or absorption/defect dominated**
   - If Q shows strong mode splitting/backscatter and strong wavelength dependence: likely scattering.
   - If Q is uniformly poor and improves dramatically after O₂ anneal: absorption/defects likely contribute [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate).

2) **If scattering/roughness dominates**
   - Move toward **redep-free Ar etch tuning** (pressure + bias) and/or geometry/layout tricks (helper features, trapezoidal mask) [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11501321/).  
   - Upgrade mask strategy (avoid soft-mask striations; consider DLC if feasible) [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/), [[7]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40502-8).  
   - Consider **ALE smoothing** as a post-step to reduce sidewall roughness without wet cleans (esp. if PPLN) [[9]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10592).  
   - Use polishing/CMP only if your geometry tolerates it (can be extremely effective) [[24]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326598284_Scattering-loss_reduction_of_ridge_waveguides_by_sidewall_polishing).

3) **If chemistry/defect layers dominate**
   - Add a **post-etch O₂ (or air) anneal** in the 450–520 °C, ~2 h class (choose based on your integration thermal budget) [[20]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10504), [[19]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.09208v1), [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate).  
   - Keep subsequent cladding deposition low-temperature when possible to preserve improvements [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate).  
   - Use wet cleans cautiously; SC‑1 can remove an oxygen-vacancy-rich surface layer but may cause undercut/delamination in capped nanostructures [[21]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396345136_Thin_film_LiNbO3_surface_preparation_using_SC-1).

4) **If you must use F-based plasmas**
   - Treat LiF as inevitable: consider **O₂ additives + temperature control** (shown to reduce roughness vs Ar additive in one SF₆ study) [[12]](https://cns1.rc.fas.harvard.edu/facilities/docs/The%20effect%20of%20a%20lithium%20niobate%20heating%20on%20the%20etching%20rate%20in%20SF6%20ICP%20plasma.pdf), and/or **periodic byproduct removal** steps (HF micro-cleans) during deep etches [[12]](https://cns1.rc.fas.harvard.edu/facilities/docs/The%20effect%20of%20a%20lithium%20niobate%20heating%20on%20the%20etching%20rate%20in%20SF6%20ICP%20plasma.pdf).  
   - Or avoid LiF by shifting to Cl-based chemistries where possible [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/).

5) **If you’re building nonlinear devices with periodic poling**
   - Avoid wet steps that can create domain-dependent corrugations; push harder on “no-wet-clean” redeposition control [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11501321/) or ALE smoothing [[9]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10592), and reserve wet steps only when proven safe for your poling period and facet set [[22]](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.10592v2).

### Key takeaways (most robust across tools)
- **Best mitigation is prevention:** redeposition-free regimes, chemistry that avoids LiF buildup, robust masks (DLC is a standout), and thermal management during etch [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11501321/), [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/), [[7]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40502-8), [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/).  
- **Best “repair” lever is annealing:** O₂/air anneals around 450–520 °C for ~2 hours have direct, quantified Q/loss benefits in thin-film LN photonics [[20]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10504), [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate), [[19]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.09208v1).  
- **Be cautious with wet cleans:** they solve residues but can introduce geometry damage, trenching, delamination, or (in PPLN) corrugations that dominate loss [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11194688/), [[21]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396345136_Thin_film_LiNbO3_surface_preparation_using_SC-1), [[22]](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.10592v2).  
- **If your nonlinear performance is unstable at power:** prioritize reducing absorption-limited loss (anneal + low-temp cladding) and separating absorption vs scattering in your diagnostics [[50]](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/7/8/081301/2835188/Reduced-material-loss-in-thin-film-lithium-niobate).

If you share (i) your LN cut/doping (MgO? stoichiometric?), (ii) etch chemistry/tool type (ICP-RIE Ar? CHF₃? SF₆? Cl₂/BCl₃?), (iii) target geometry (ridge vs fully etched strip; etch depth), and (iv) whether you’re on PPLN, I can map these options into a more specific recommended process sequence and risk ranking.
