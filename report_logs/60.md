QUESTION:
How to conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in the cislunar space, and support the effectiveness of short-term cislunar space tracking and monitoring tasks?

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (6 total):
  #1: Research mission objectives and performance requirements for cislunar Space Situational Awareness (SSA) focused on short-term tracking/monitoring (days–weeks): target classes (spacecraft, rocket bodies, debris), common cislunar orbits/trajectories (NRHO, DRO, halo, transfers, flybys), and translate into measurable metrics (detection probability, catalog completeness, latency, angular/range accuracy, revisit/custody time). Include any recent (2024–2026) publications, standards, or program requirements.
  #2: Research sensing modalities and architectures suitable for cislunar target detection/tracking in 2024–2026: ground/space optical, IR, radar/bi-static radar, laser ranging, signals of opportunity, cooperative beacons. Assess geometry/illumination constraints, link budgets, coverage gaps; and summarize recommended sensor placement options (Earth-based networks, GEO/HEO relays, lunar orbiters, Earth–Moon L1/L2 sentinels).
  #3: Research orbit determination/prediction and multi-sensor fusion methods for cislunar dynamics and short-term tasking: high-fidelity models (3-body, SRP, maneuvers), angles-only vs range+angle, batch vs sequential filters, uncertainty propagation, maneuver detection, track association under sparse data, catalog maintenance and data standards/metadata for interoperability. Provide validation approaches using recent cislunar mission ephemerides and public data.
  #4: Research planning, tasking, and scheduling strategies that maximize short-term (hours–days) effectiveness for cislunar tracking/monitoring: adaptive scheduling, cueing between sensors, search vs custody allocation, handoffs, tracklet design, prioritization under limited resources, and how to quantify performance (coverage, latency, probability of reacquisition, time-to-custody) via simulation/analytics. Include relevant 2024–2026 literature or operational concepts (e.g., GEODSS, space-based sentinels, DSN) and any metrics/algorithms (MCTS, optimization, reinforcement learning, etc.).
  #5: Research current (2024–2026) organizational, policy, and operational frameworks affecting cislunar SSA/SDA and data sharing: U.S. civil vs military roles (Space Force, NOAA/OSC TraCSS), international coordination (Artemis Accords, IADC/UNOOSA), lunar safety zones/deconfliction, spectrum and laser deconfliction, and any emerging governance models or best-practice CONOPS for sharing cislunar SSA data while balancing security and safety.
  #6: Research best-practice end-to-end CONOPS for comprehensive cislunar situational awareness systems (sensor-to-catalog-to-users), emphasizing interoperability standards (CCSDS ODM/TDM/CDM, SPICE), quality metrics, and practical implementation steps (data pipelines, catalog maintenance, alerting). Focus on 2024–2026 guidance from NASA, DoD, Office of Space Commerce, CCSDS, or major SSA providers.

ANSWER:
## 1) What “comprehensive, accurate cislunar situational awareness” must achieve (and why cislunar is different)

### 1.1 Core mission functions (what you must be able to do)
Across recent cislunar SSA/SDA work, the capability is often decomposed into **search → detect → track → recognize/characterize → maintain custody**, ultimately enabling safe operations and decision support (e.g., conjunction screening, threat warning, anomaly response) [[7]](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21680256251390412), [[4]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Cislunar_SDA/Evans.pdf). “Custody” is repeatedly treated as the operational end-state: you can predict where an object will be with enough confidence that you can (a) reacquire it with available sensors and (b) assess safety/relevance [[4]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Cislunar_SDA/Evans.pdf), [[44]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Givens.pdf).

### 1.2 Target classes you must plan for
Operational message standards and current cislunar SDA literature converge on target classes including:
- **Active payloads** (cooperative and non-cooperative) [[6]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06425), [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf)
- **Rocket bodies** and **mission-related objects** [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf), [[21]](https://afresearchlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AFRL_CHPS_FS_0222.pdf)
- **Debris fragments** (including “unknown/other” until classified) [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf)
- (Sometimes included as hazards) **near-Earth asteroids / mini-moons** for radar detection efforts, though this is adjacent to “SSA” [[16]](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/site/research/media/posters/2023/R20045p.pdf), [[21]](https://afresearchlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AFRL_CHPS_FS_0222.pdf)

Operationally important attributes that directly affect short-term tracking effectiveness include:
- **Maneuverability** and **ops status** (explicit fields in conjunction products) [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf)
- **Signature cues** such as optical magnitude and radar cross section (recommended as helpful for association and “combat ID”-type discrimination) [[33]](https://ccsds.org/Pubs/503x0b2c1.pdf), [[32]](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cislunar_ssa_proposed_message_set-nov2021_rev2_without_emailspdf.pdf)

### 1.3 Cislunar orbit/trajectory regimes that drive observability and tracking difficulty
You must expect both **stable long-lived families** and **fast transfers** that compress reaction time:
- **NRHO (Gateway-like)**: strong dynamical sensitivity near perilune; short “high sensitivity” arc lasts hours inside a multi-day period (e.g., ~7 hours below 10,000 km altitude in a 6.5-day NRHO) [[5]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20220000182/downloads/NRHO_OD.pdf)
- **Halo, Lyapunov, axial, triangular-point periodic orbits; DROs** [[4]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Cislunar_SDA/Evans.pdf)
- **Transfers/flybys** (including low-energy transfers with long gaps and geometry-driven invisibility) [[44]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Givens.pdf)

### 1.4 Cislunar-specific constraints (what breaks Earth-orbit SSA assumptions)
Key constraints repeatedly emphasized:
- **Vast search volume** (often characterized as ~1000× GEO volume) [[14]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Segal.pdf), [[13]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Poster/Badura.pdf)
- **Time-varying geometry/illumination** and exclusion zones (Sun/Earth/Moon) dominating when/where optical sensors can see [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf), [[56]](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/advspace.publicshare/Thompson+-+Simulated+Optical+Measurements+for+Cislunar+OD.pdf)
- **Angles-only short-arc ambiguity** (object appears to move slowly; poor geometric diversity; “too-short-arc” is worse than GEO) [[23]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Bolden.pdf)
- **Non-Keplerian dynamics and sensitivity** (three-body effects, SRP, chaotic boundaries) driving non-Gaussian uncertainty growth [[23]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Bolden.pdf), [[24]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Cislunar-SSA/Iannamorelli.pdf)

---

## 2) Translate objectives into measurable short-term performance requirements (days–weeks)

You generally need **two layers of requirements**: (A) *surveillance/search* requirements for discovering/cueing and (B) *custody/maintenance* requirements for keeping tracks “alive” with bounded uncertainty.

### 2.1 Minimum set of performance metrics to manage (operationally measurable)
**Detection / search**
- Probability of detection **Pd**, false alarm rate **Pfa**, and **SNR** (explicitly used as detection quantifiers) [[7]](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21680256251390412)
- Limiting magnitude / sensitivity assumptions (often used as a proxy in architecture studies) [[3]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Kim.pdf), [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)
- Search coverage: percent of defined volume observed (not just visible)

**Coverage & timeliness**
- **Observability** (geometric + radiometric “can see it”) vs **capacity** (can actually observe it given FOV, slew, dwell, scheduling constraints) [[3]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Kim.pdf), [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)
- **Latency**: time from measurement → updated state/covariance → published tasking/alerts (civil CA ecosystems often push toward minutes-to-hours in Earth orbit; cislunar SDA timeliness is often framed as **hours**, while cislunar STM/custody for stable objects may tolerate **days**) [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)
- **Revisit / reacquisition time** and **time-to-custody** (explicitly used as a performance metric in reacquisition planning work) [[46]](https://keithlegrand.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Chaturvedi-2025-Information-Driven-Cislunar-Space-Object-Reacquisition.pdf)

**Track quality / custody**
- State uncertainty (covariance) metrics: e.g., trace of position/velocity covariance; percent of “acceptable” observable epochs in a month-by-day geometry grid [[4]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Cislunar_SDA/Evans.pdf)
- Consistency metrics such as **Mahalanobis distance** (used both for navigation/filter consistency and for conjunction products) [[5]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20220000182/downloads/NRHO_OD.pdf), [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf)
- Catalog completeness (% objects in ROI with maintained custody) and “shelf-life” of covariance under propagation assumptions [[51]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Harris.pdf)

**Conjunction decision quality (when safety is the aim)**
- Miss distance, Pc, screening windows, covariance provenance fields (standardized in CDM specifications) [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf), [[72]](https://ccsds.org/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/9-6f599803174a64f5da08b9814720b5c4/2025/02/508x0p11.pdf)

### 2.2 Short-term task effectiveness: practical “threshold” thinking
Public sources rarely publish one authoritative numeric table for cislunar SSA performance thresholds, but the literature suggests how to set thresholds:
- Define an **“acceptable covariance”** boundary linked to whether the next observation is feasible with your sensor FOV/agility and expected visibility constraints [[4]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Cislunar_SDA/Evans.pdf), [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf)
- Trigger “localized search” when covariance exceeds a threshold (an explicit concept in decentralized tasking frameworks) [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf)
- For threat-warning style SDA volumes, define timeliness by **minimum warning time** (e.g., a design example uses 6 hours as a minimum warning time for GEO threats to define a cislunar surveillance volume boundary) [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)

---

## 3) Sensing modalities for cislunar targets (what works, what fails, and how to combine them)

No single modality gives comprehensive coverage. The most robust approach is **multi-phenomenology + multi-geometry**, so that one sensor’s outages (phase angle, exclusion cones, weather, DSN contention) are compensated by another.

### 3.1 Ground-based optical (EO) networks: useful, but must be made “search-feasible”
**Strengths**
- Scalable networks can contribute immediately; useful for certain resonant orbits and objects that remain favorable from Earth geometry [[56]](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/advspace.publicshare/Thompson+-+Simulated+Optical+Measurements+for+Cislunar+OD.pdf)
- Can be adapted using **dynamically informed search regions** to avoid all-sky scanning

**Key limitation**
- All-sky search is infeasible at cislunar scales; optical performance collapses in certain geometries (Moon background, solar phase) [[14]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Segal.pdf), [[13]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Poster/Badura.pdf)

**Best-practice techniques shown in recent work**
- Use reachability / Poincaré-type analyses to identify likely corridor crossings and reduce search space (one GEODSS-focused study reports up to **85.3% reduction** in required search area vs 4π search) [[14]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Segal.pdf)
- Combine cislunar search as a **secondary mission** during GEO catalog operations; “serendipitous acquisition” in GEO-like operations captured up to ~34% of relevant targets in 24 hours in that simulation context [[14]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Segal.pdf)
- Use search patterns that revisit more than once per day (box scans) rather than declination stripes that revisit only daily [[14]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Segal.pdf)

### 3.2 Space-based optical/IR sensors: the main path to persistent cislunar SDA
**Why they matter**
- Ground networks are “ill-equipped” alone for cislunar volumes; in-space assets reduce standoff range and improve geometric diversity [[3]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Kim.pdf), [[13]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Poster/Badura.pdf)

**Operational constraints you must model**
- Exclusion zones (Moon/Earth/Sun), occultation, eclipse, and solar phase angle dependencies [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf), [[56]](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/advspace.publicshare/Thompson+-+Simulated+Optical+Measurements+for+Cislunar+OD.pdf)
- A reported particularly hard geometry is near the Earth–Moon line where dim objects are hard to see against lunar background (“cone of shame” described as ~30° around Earth–Moon direction, attributed to AFRL in one poster) [[13]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Poster/Badura.pdf)

**Architecture metric guidance**
- Optimize not just “visibility,” but **capacity**: percent of volume you can actually observe subject to sensor FOV, slew, dwell, and tasking limits [[3]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Kim.pdf), [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)
- Treat scheduling as part of architecture; otherwise you overestimate performance [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)

**Programmatic direction (examples)**
- AFRL/Space Force **CHPS / Oracle** concept: wide-field sensors for discovery + narrow-field more sensitive sensors for custody; onboard image processing and OD; designed to track objects at lunar distance where most legacy sensors are not designed to operate [[21]](https://afresearchlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AFRL_CHPS_FS_0222.pdf), [[22]](https://advancedspace.com/afrl-awards-oracle-contract/)
- Space Force **Oracle‑M**: a pathfinder emphasizing persistent awareness, tracking/trajectory estimation, and cloud-based ground operations and data distribution beyond GEO [[76]](https://www.ssc.spaceforce.mil/Newsroom/Article/4176371/oracle-m-hot-fire-test-a-major-milestone-in-cislunar-space-situational-awarenes)

### 3.3 Radar (including bistatic “planetary radar style”): high-value when available, but scarce
**Why radar matters in cislunar**
- Provides **range and Doppler**, which can break angles-only ambiguity and rapidly improve OD when optical geometry is poor.

**Evidence of feasibility at lunar distances**
- Bistatic radar detected and helped estimate Chandrayaan‑1’s orbit phase (GSSR transmit, GBT receive), and radar has been used in spacecraft recovery contexts (e.g., Lunar Trailblazer trajectory determination) [[17]](https://www.kiss.caltech.edu/final_reports/NextGeneration-PlanetaryRadar-final%202025-09-19.pdf)
- JPL’s cis-lunar space debris radar effort aims to detect/characterize objects at lunar distance and improve sensitivity via signal processing to enable detection toward ~1 m-class targets (goal stated) [[16]](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/site/research/media/posters/2023/R20045p.pdf)

**Practical constraints**
- Limited radar assets, high cost, scheduling competition, and geometry constraints; improvements often focus on processing because physical parameters are fixed [[16]](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/site/research/media/posters/2023/R20045p.pdf), [[17]](https://www.kiss.caltech.edu/final_reports/NextGeneration-PlanetaryRadar-final%202025-09-19.pdf)

### 3.4 Laser ranging (SLR/LLR-like): extremely precise, but typically cooperative (or special cases)
- Demonstrated lunar-distance laser ranging to a DRO satellite at ~350,000 km using a 1.2 m ground system (reported as China’s first such experiment) [[18]](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202504/t20250427_1042108.shtml)
- In practice, supports **high-precision orbit improvement** when targets carry retroreflectors or when cooperative conditions exist.

### 3.5 Signals of opportunity & cooperative PNT/comm (GNSS at the Moon, LunaNet)
These are not primary non-cooperative detection tools, but they can transform custody for cooperative actors and reduce burden on SSA sensors.

- **LuGRE** demonstrates GNSS signal reception at lunar distance (GPS+Galileo), with antenna and operations constraints (Earth-pointing high-gain L-band antenna; modeled C/N0 peaks >30 dB‑Hz main lobes) and planned datasets to support lunar GNSS receiver development [[19]](https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/icg/2024/WG-B_Lunar_PNT_Jun24/LunarPNT_Jun24_01_03.pdf)
- **LunaNet** defines an interoperability framework (“network of networks”) for comm and PNT services around the Moon, enabling multi-provider architectures and standard interfaces [[20]](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/lunanet-interoperability-specification-v5-baseline.pdf)

**Implication for cislunar SSA CONOPS**
- Make cooperative missions “easy to track” via standardized ephemeris sharing and interoperable services; reserve scarce non-cooperative sensing for unknowns and suspicious objects.

---

## 4) Sensor placement & architecture: how to get comprehensive coverage (and avoid common failure modes)

### 4.1 Use a layered architecture (Earth-based + near-Earth + cislunar sentinels)
A practical, high-confidence approach is **layering**:

1) **Earth-based optical networks** for broad-area monitoring and cueing when geometry is favorable, enhanced by reduced search regions [[14]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Segal.pdf)  
2) **Near-Earth space-based sensors** (xGEO/HEO-like vantage points) to reduce weather constraints and provide different phase/exclusion geometry (architecture studies include “XGEO” candidates) [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)  
3) **Cislunar sentinels** (L1/L2 families, resonant Lyapunov/halo, DRO) to close gaps near the Moon direction and to keep custody through geometries that defeat Earth-based sensors [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf), [[15]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09732), [[13]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Poster/Badura.pdf)

This matches the repeated conclusion that **single-sensor or single-orbit-family** approaches are insufficient for persistent cislunar SDA [[13]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Poster/Badura.pdf), [[15]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09732).

### 4.2 Pick observer orbits using the right metrics (not just “can see it”)
**Observability alone is insufficient**; you need **capacity** (includes FOV/agility/scheduling) to avoid architectures that look good on paper but can’t be tasked effectively [[3]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Kim.pdf), [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf).

Key orbit-family insights from recent studies:
- L1/L2 family geometry can be phased to improve sustained line-of-sight and solar geometry for certain corridor volumes (reported as a benefit in reviewed work) [[56]](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/advspace.publicshare/Thompson+-+Simulated+Optical+Measurements+for+Cislunar+OD.pdf)
- Out-of-plane amplitude can reduce corridor coverage in some L1 halo family cases (example result reported) [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)
- Stability and station-keeping cost matter operationally; some frameworks explicitly propose multi-objective trade-offs including orbit instability and navigation uncertainty, not just coverage [[13]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Poster/Badura.pdf)

### 4.3 Explicitly model “hard” geometry problems early
If you do not explicitly simulate:
- Moon exclusion cones and lunar background constraints [[56]](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/advspace.publicshare/Thompson+-+Simulated+Optical+Measurements+for+Cislunar+OD.pdf), [[13]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Poster/Badura.pdf)
- Time-varying Sun direction in the rotating frame [[15]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09732)
- Eclipses/occultation and solar phase functions [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)

…you will systematically overestimate custody and underestimate reacquisition time.

---

## 5) Orbit determination & prediction: how to stay accurate over hours–weeks in a nonlinear regime

### 5.1 Use a model hierarchy (fast → accurate) and switch adaptively
You need both responsiveness for short-term tasking and enough fidelity to avoid covariance blow-up and false confidence.

**Dynamics models commonly used**
- **CR3BP/CRTBP** for planning, orbit-family reasoning, and some filters [[4]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Cislunar_SDA/Evans.pdf), [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf), [[24]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Cislunar-SSA/Iannamorelli.pdf)
- **Full ephemeris** with multi-body point masses and SRP for higher-fidelity truth/estimation and for converting CR3BP periodic solutions into ephemeris trajectories via patch points and multi-shooting [[56]](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/advspace.publicshare/Thompson+-+Simulated+Optical+Measurements+for+Cislunar+OD.pdf), [[25]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2021/Poster/Thompson.pdf)
- Near the Moon (or lunar orbiters): high-degree gravity fields and tides become important for prediction accuracy and filter stability (e.g., 200×200 lunar gravity used in LRO batch OD; SRP modeling is a dominant error source) [[26]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150020827/downloads/20150020827.pdf)

**Best practice**
- Use low-fidelity models for fast propagation / broad hypothesis maintenance, then repropagate “important samples” with high fidelity when needed. Adaptive bi-fidelity uncertainty propagation has been demonstrated to improve computational efficiency without degrading tracking accuracy in simulated cislunar multi-target scenarios [[48]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Cislunar_SDA/Reifler.pdf).

### 5.2 Handle angles-only tracking as a non-Gaussian, multi-hypothesis problem
In cislunar, angles-only short arcs frequently do not constrain range/range-rate; uncertainty becomes **multi-modal** and non-Gaussian [[23]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Bolden.pdf).

Approaches shown in recent literature:
- **Probabilistic Admissible Region (PAR)** initialization extended to cislunar, coupled to a Particle Gaussian Mixture Filter (PGMF) to preserve multimodality through nonlinear dynamics and gaps [[23]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Bolden.pdf)
- **Gaussian-mixture multi-model filtering** for maneuvering targets with jump-Markov modes (ballistic vs thrusting), with adaptive mixture component splitting to maintain resolution under long gaps and nonlinearities [[24]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Cislunar-SSA/Iannamorelli.pdf)
- **Collocation-based angles-only IOD** (sparse grid collocation) intended to increase convergence region and stability across long gaps (proposed benefit: reduce burdensome tasking for angular-rate estimation) [[50]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40295-025-00491-w)
- **ML-assisted IOD** (MCCLOD): neural nets trained on CRTBP orbit families to map angles-only measurements into initial state estimates; reported large position error improvements in tested halo-orbit scenarios and improved least-squares convergence consistency [[49]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Cislunar_SDA/Ojeda-Romero.pdf)

### 5.3 Use sequential estimation + smoothing for operational “best estimated trajectories”
Operational navigation practice in difficult regimes frequently uses:
- A forward filter for near-real-time state updates
- A backward smoother to produce a best estimated trajectory (BET) and to diagnose/filter-tune via filter–smoother consistency tests [[29]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20180003657/downloads/20180003657.pdf)

This pattern is explicitly seen in lunar OD improvements (e.g., LRO sequential EKF + smoothing) where smoothing significantly improved definitive accuracy versus filtered-only solutions [[26]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150020827/downloads/20150020827.pdf). Even if your end product is SDA rather than navigation, the same idea helps: **short-term decisions** use the forward estimate; **catalog truth maintenance** uses smoothed solutions when time permits.

### 5.4 Model maneuvers explicitly (or you will lose custody)
Short-term cislunar monitoring is dominated by the possibility of **unannounced maneuvers** and by SRP/model mismatch.

Useful method families:
- Stochastic hybrid / mode-switching models with Sequential Monte Carlo for maneuver detection under scarce optical data [[27]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117722001302)
- Jump-Markov / IMM-like Gaussian mixture filtering for ballistic vs thrusting dynamics [[24]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Cislunar-SSA/Iannamorelli.pdf)
- Operationally, batch OD arcs are often broken around maneuvers; sequential filters may need process-noise strategies to avoid divergence when the model is incomplete [[26]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150020827/downloads/20150020827.pdf), [[28]](https://artemis.igpp.ucla.edu/pubs/2011_nonrefereed/AAS_11-514.pdf)

### 5.5 Measurement fusion: prioritize adding range/Doppler when possible
Angles-only is workable but fragile. Whenever possible, fuse:
- Optical angles (from multiple geometries)
- Radar range/Doppler (bistatic radar can provide strong constraints at lunar distance when available) [[17]](https://www.kiss.caltech.edu/final_reports/NextGeneration-PlanetaryRadar-final%202025-09-19.pdf)
- Laser ranging (for cooperative targets) [[18]](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202504/t20250427_1042108.shtml)
- Cooperative ephemerides and tracking data submissions (civil frameworks increasingly expect operator ephemeris submission in standardized formats) [[60]](https://space.commerce.gov/tracss-listening-session-updated-cdm-ocm-specifications/)

---

## 6) Multi-sensor fusion, association, and catalog maintenance (how to avoid “track chaos”)

### 6.1 Treat association as a first-class problem (especially with sparse tracklets)
Association failures are a primary way short-term monitoring collapses: you “see something,” but you cannot reliably match it to a catalog object, and you waste scarce sensor time.

Relevant techniques from recent work:
- **Multi-frame observation-to-orbit association (OTOA)** using covariance-informed Mahalanobis distance gating across all measurements in a tracklet (chi-square gating often at 99% significance), using Unscented Transform to project state covariance into measurement space [[51]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Harris.pdf)
- **MCMC-based tracklet likelihoods** to represent non-Gaussian processed measurements in Cartesian space, then **JPDA** for multi-target tracking in congested scenarios [[31]](https://sites.utexas.edu/near/files/2024/07/durant_2024_aas.pdf)
- Include measurement formation covariance and signature metadata (optical magnitude / RCS) because it improves association robustness (explicitly recommended in tracking-data standards context) [[33]](https://ccsds.org/Pubs/503x0b2c1.pdf), [[32]](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cislunar_ssa_proposed_message_set-nov2021_rev2_without_emailspdf.pdf)

### 6.2 Manage covariance “shelf-life” and prevent false confidence
A repeated caution: if you propagate too long with insufficient fidelity or through chaotic regimes, your Gaussian covariance may cease to represent reality; association gates become misleading [[51]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Harris.pdf), [[23]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Bolden.pdf). Operational mitigations:
- Use mixture/particle representations when non-Gaussian growth is expected [[23]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Bolden.pdf), [[24]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Cislunar-SSA/Iannamorelli.pdf), [[31]](https://sites.utexas.edu/near/files/2024/07/durant_2024_aas.pdf)
- Switch to higher-fidelity propagation near sensitive regions (e.g., near-lunar passes) [[48]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Cislunar_SDA/Reifler.pdf)
- Use consistency diagnostics (innovation tests; filter–smoother consistency) [[29]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20180003657/downloads/20180003657.pdf), [[26]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150020827/downloads/20150020827.pdf)

### 6.3 Maintain a feedback-driven catalog (custody is a loop, not a database)
Recent cislunar custody concepts emphasize:
- Predict likely destinations / reachable regions
- Plan observations using sensor models
- Propagate uncertainty in non-Gaussian form
- Update a catalog and immediately feed results back into tasking decisions [[44]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Givens.pdf)

This “closed loop” is essential for short-term effectiveness because the main operational question is: **what do we point next, and when, to avoid losing the object?**

---

## 7) Tasking and scheduling: how to maximize short-term tracking/monitoring effectiveness (hours–days)

### 7.1 Explicitly separate “search” from “custody maintenance”
Operationally, you must continually decide how much sensor time goes to:
- **Search/discovery** (wide-field scanning, low prior information)
- **Custody** (narrow-field, high-precision follow-ups to reduce covariance)

Architectures that optimize only “visibility” tend to ignore this real constraint; capacity-aware design and scheduling explicitly incorporate it [[3]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Kim.pdf), [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf).

### 7.2 Use trigger-based “localized search” when a track is at risk
A concrete decentralized concept:
- When covariance grows beyond a threshold, trigger a **localized raster search** around the predicted measurement-space region, constrained by FOV, occlusions, and sensor availability [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf)
- Use “tracking tip” messages (time, state, covariance) to hand off to another sensor and initiate search [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf)

### 7.3 Use planning under uncertainty (POMDP/MCTS) for reacquisition
Reacquiring a cislunar object after an unknown maneuver during a gap is a canonical short-term challenge. A demonstrated approach:
- Model as a **POMDP** with an RFS observation model (handles missed detections and false alarms)
- Use **MCTS with double progressive widening** to choose repointing actions online
- Evaluate with **time-to-reacquire**; this approach outperformed random and greedy baselines in Monte Carlo trials in the reported study [[46]](https://keithlegrand.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Chaturvedi-2025-Information-Driven-Cislunar-Space-Object-Reacquisition.pdf)

### 7.4 Use finite-horizon decision processes for multi-sensor tasking (SMDP)
A cislunar-focused tasking framework models scheduling as a **semi-Markov decision process**, generating locally optimal tasking policies over a finite planning horizon to minimize tracking uncertainty and coordinate decentralized sensors [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf). Key operational implications:
- Build policies that decide between “keep tracking” vs “search”
- Enable selective information sharing between platforms to coordinate handoffs [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf)

### 7.5 Optimize schedules with capacity metrics (and include slew/dwell/overlap constraints)
Scheduling approaches in cislunar architecture work explicitly optimize pointing and dwell times to maximize volume observed subject to constraints and can target metrics like **revisit time** and coverage percentage [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf). This matters because short-term effectiveness usually fails due to:
- Too few revisits during a sensitive arc
- Too slow reaction to geometry changes or maneuvers
- Excess overlap (wasting multiple sensors on the same volume)

### 7.6 Don’t ignore shared-resource scheduling realities (DSN analogy)
Deep-space tracking resources are oversubscribed and require weeks-to-months planning with real-time change management; DSN scheduling is a concrete example of multi-constraint scheduling with automated conflict resolution and replanning tools used operationally [[55]](https://ai.jpl.nasa.gov/public/projects/sss/). Cislunar monitoring concepts that depend on DSN-like assets (radiometrics, bistatic radar receivers) must incorporate:
- Long-horizon booking + short-horizon replanning
- Priority rules and contingency hooks (lost spacecraft, high Pc events)

---

## 8) Validation: how to prove your cislunar SSA is accurate (not just plausible)

### 8.1 Validate dynamics + estimation against real mission truth products
Best practice is to validate at three levels:

**(1) Propagation-only validation**
- Propagate with your chosen force model and compare to authoritative ephemerides; ensure constants and frames match.

**(2) OD/filter validation**
- Simulate or ingest tracking measurements, run OD, compare reconstructed trajectory to “truth” ephemerides, and analyze residuals and consistency.

**(3) Tasking effectiveness validation**
- Run end-to-end closed-loop simulations: sensor constraints → measurements → association → OD → predicted covariance growth → scheduling decisions → reacquisition probability.

### 8.2 Public datasets that support cislunar/lunar validation
- **LRO SPICE reconstructed ephemerides** (merged reconstructed SPKs) provide “as-flown” truth products for lunar orbit dynamics/OD validation [[40]](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/pds/data/lro-l-spice-6-v1.0/lrosp_1000/data/spk/spkinfo.txt)
- **GRAIL SPICE archive** supports lunar dynamics and tracking geometry validation pipelines [[42]](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/pds/data/grail-l-spice-6-v1.0/grlsp_1000/aareadme.htm)
- **ARTEMIS SPKs** exist but are labeled “unofficial products” and NAIF notes ephemeris validity is unknown by NAIF (use with caution / cross-check) [[39]](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/THEMIS/kernels/spk/aareadme.txt)

General access/usage scaffolding:
- NAIF provides access to SPICE kernels (PDS archives and operational kernels) [[37]](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data.html)
- SPICE usage/distribution rules were updated in 2024 and include guidance on kernel validation and redistribution practices [[77]](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/rules.html)

### 8.3 Validation diagnostics you should institutionalize
- Residual whiteness and scaled residual distributions [[26]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150020827/downloads/20150020827.pdf)
- Filter–smoother consistency tests (McReynolds-type) to detect mismodeled forces/process noise [[26]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150020827/downloads/20150020827.pdf), [[29]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20180003657/downloads/20180003657.pdf)
- For conjunction quality: track how Pc/miss distance stability changes with new data; monitor dilution indicators where used [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf)

---

## 9) Interoperability, data standards, and quality metadata (so multi-organization SSA actually works)

### 9.1 Use CCSDS message families as the backbone (and adopt TraCSS specs where relevant)
A practical interoperability stack for cislunar SSA operations:

**Measurements**
- **CCSDS Tracking Data Message (TDM)**: standardized exchange of tracking data (range, Doppler, angles, etc.), supports KVN/XML and ICD-defined exchange mechanisms; includes SSA-motivated keywords like optical magnitude and RCS [[33]](https://ccsds.org/Pubs/503x0b2c1.pdf)

**Ephemerides / states / maneuvers / covariances**
- **CCSDS Orbit Data Messages (ODM)** family (OPM/OMM/OEM/OCM) is the baseline for orbit interchange; OEM supports optional covariance [[8]](https://www.space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/January-2024-Recommendations-TraCSS-Standards-for-Data-Exchange.pdf), [[34]](https://ccsds.org/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/5-448e85c647331d9cbaf66c096458bdd5/2025/11/502x0b3e2.pdf)

**Conjunction products**
- **CCSDS CDM** (baseline standard; March 2024 Pink Book draft emphasizes interoperability and automation but not algorithms) [[72]](https://ccsds.org/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/9-6f599803174a64f5da08b9814720b5c4/2025/02/508x0p11.pdf)
- **TraCSS CDM specifications** define operational field expectations and machine-readable formats (KVN/XML/JSON) with many provenance/quality fields (observation spans, counts, residual acceptance, WRMS, force model flags) [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf)

### 9.2 Prefer ephemeris+covariance distribution over “here’s a state, good luck”
A cislunar-specific recommendation from a NASA technical steering group (noting the document predates 2024 but addresses the core issue): distribute **propagated ephemerides with covariances** so recipients can interpolate rather than implement and validate complex cislunar propagators themselves [[32]](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cislunar_ssa_proposed_message_set-nov2021_rev2_without_emailspdf.pdf). This directly improves short-term effectiveness because:
- It reduces cross-organization latency to usable predictions
- It reduces divergence due to mismatched force models
- It standardizes what “the predicted track” means

### 9.3 Use civil STC/SSA frameworks where safety is the objective (TraCSS)
TraCSS is explicitly being fielded as a **civil SSA / space traffic coordination** system to deliver conjunction assessment products to operators, initially via CDMs and evolving specs [[57]](https://space.commerce.gov/noaa-awards-tracss-presentation-layer-contract/), [[69]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/January-2024-Recommendations-TraCSS-Standards-for-Data-Exchange.pdf). Key operational characteristics relevant to short-term monitoring ecosystems:
- Cloud-based ingest/process/disseminate concept; stores data from DoD, commercial SSA providers, operators, and select partners [[69]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/January-2024-Recommendations-TraCSS-Standards-for-Data-Exchange.pdf)
- Iterative stakeholder-driven specs and multi-format outputs [[58]](https://space.commerce.gov/tracss-listening-session-conjunction-data-message-cdm-specification/), [[59]](https://space.commerce.gov/osc-publishes-updated-tracss-specifications/)
- TraCSS CDM includes dissemination control concepts and a public notification mechanism (TCN) for alertable cases [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf)
- TraCSS catalog format integrates multiple sources and is intended to be broadly usable under an open data paradigm (with governance and edit controls for key identifiers) [[74]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TraCSS-SPEC-003-TraCSS-Cat-Format-v2.0.5.pdf)

---

## 10) Organizational/policy frameworks that shape “how” you can do cislunar SSA (2024–2026)

### 10.1 U.S. policy direction: extend SSA into cislunar + share data for safety
The U.S. National Cislunar S&T Action Plan explicitly calls to extend SSA into cislunar space, develop/improve sensors, increase cooperation and data exchanges, develop an integrated cislunar object catalog, and develop procedures for publicly sharing cislunar SSA data to support spaceflight safety [[1]](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cislunar-Implementation-Plan-Final.pdf). It also emphasizes standardized lunar time/reference systems as foundational enablers for interoperable operations [[1]](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cislunar-Implementation-Plan-Final.pdf).

### 10.2 Civil vs military roles and the transition of “basic SSA services”
The Office of Space Commerce frames TraCSS as implementing DOC responsibility under SPD‑3 to provide civil/commercial SSA services, with DoD and DOC sharing unclassified data as part of the transition [[69]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/January-2024-Recommendations-TraCSS-Standards-for-Data-Exchange.pdf). This shapes operational reality: many safety-of-flight products will be delivered through civil pipelines even if some sensing and catalog heritage remains defense-origin.

### 10.3 Norms for lunar deconfliction (“safety zones”) and transparency
The Artemis Accords (non-binding) emphasize transparency, registration, and deconfliction via notification and coordination; “safety zones” are framed as temporary coordination areas sized by engineering/scientific principles while respecting free access and due regard [[64]](https://2021-2025.state.gov/artemis-accords/), [[65]](https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-accords/). NASA also notes that practical deconfliction details lack broad technical consensus and are still being actively developed [[66]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240012064). For cislunar SSA, this implies:
- You should expect increasing demand for **published operational intent/location** around lunar activities
- SSA systems should support “due regard” by providing reliable, shareable situational context without forcing disclosure of sensitive details

### 10.4 Emerging multilateral work (still draft / evolving)
UNCOPUOS working drafts on space resource activities include draft recommended principles on timely information sharing, due regard, consultation, and minimizing debris around the Moon, but the text is explicitly non-binding and still under negotiation [[68]](https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/copuos/lsc/space-resources/Updated_Initial_draft_set_of_recommended_principles_15_October_2025.pdf).

---

## 11) A practical end-to-end CONOPS that supports short-term cislunar tracking/monitoring

Below is a concrete, implementable concept of operations that aligns with the constraints and best practices evidenced in the sources.

### 11.1 Define your cislunar “regions of interest” (ROIs) and time-critical corridors
1) Partition the domain into operational ROIs:
- Earth–Moon transfer corridor(s)
- L1/L2 neighborhood and common periodic orbit families (NRHO/halo/Lyapunov)
- Lunar orbit regimes (LLO/frozen, DRO)
2) For each ROI define:
- Minimum warning time (hours vs days) consistent with mission type (SDA vs STM) [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)
- Required custody threshold: maximum allowable covariance that still enables reacquisition with available sensors (FOV/agility constraints) [[4]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Cislunar_SDA/Evans.pdf), [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf)

### 11.2 Build a layered sensor plan with cueing rules
**Layer A: wide-area cueing**
- Ground EO networks with dynamically reduced search regions and periodic scans [[14]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Segal.pdf)
- Opportunistic acquisitions during other missions (e.g., GEO maintenance) [[14]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2025/Poster/Segal.pdf)

**Layer B: custody refinement**
- Space-based optical sensors (including cislunar sentinels when available) designed for wide-field discovery + narrow-field custody [[21]](https://afresearchlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AFRL_CHPS_FS_0222.pdf)
- When available, bistatic radar sessions to inject range/Doppler for ambiguity-breaking in high-priority cases [[17]](https://www.kiss.caltech.edu/final_reports/NextGeneration-PlanetaryRadar-final%202025-09-19.pdf)

**Cueing/handoff rules**
- Standardize “tip” messages containing (time, state, covariance) to trigger localized search by another sensor [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf)
- Trigger localized search when covariance growth crosses a threshold, not after you already lost the object [[45]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Correa.pdf)

### 11.3 Run a closed-loop estimation + planning engine (multi-hypothesis by default)
**Initialization**
- Use PAR-style probabilistic initialization when angles-only arcs are too short [[23]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Bolden.pdf)
- Consider ML-assisted IOD as a triage accelerator for certain orbit-family regimes, but keep physics-based validation gates [[49]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Cislunar_SDA/Ojeda-Romero.pdf)

**Tracking**
- For sparse cislunar angles-only, use mixture/particle hybrid representations to avoid Gaussian collapse [[23]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Bolden.pdf), [[24]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Cislunar-SSA/Iannamorelli.pdf), [[31]](https://sites.utexas.edu/near/files/2024/07/durant_2024_aas.pdf)
- Include maneuver hypotheses explicitly (jump models / hybrid systems) [[24]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Cislunar-SSA/Iannamorelli.pdf), [[27]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117722001302)

**Planning**
- Use capacity-aware scheduling for routine operations (maximize observed volume subject to slew/dwell/constraints) [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)
- Use POMDP/MCTS planners for time-critical reacquisition after gaps/maneuver suspicion; measure success by time-to-reacquire [[46]](https://keithlegrand.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Chaturvedi-2025-Information-Driven-Cislunar-Space-Object-Reacquisition.pdf)

### 11.4 Standardize outputs and quality metadata so users can act quickly
- Publish tracking data via **TDM** when exchanging measurements [[33]](https://ccsds.org/Pubs/503x0b2c1.pdf)
- Publish trajectories via **OEM/OCM** (ephemeris + covariance) for cislunar, rather than relying on every recipient to replicate propagation [[32]](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cislunar_ssa_proposed_message_set-nov2021_rev2_without_emailspdf.pdf), [[8]](https://www.space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/January-2024-Recommendations-TraCSS-Standards-for-Data-Exchange.pdf)
- Publish conjunction products via **CDM** (CCSDS-aligned; TraCSS field conventions where applicable) [[72]](https://ccsds.org/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/9-6f599803174a64f5da08b9814720b5c4/2025/02/508x0p11.pdf), [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf)
- Track quality fields: observation spans, counts, WRMS, covariance method, force model flags (already standardized in TraCSS-style CDMs) [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf)

### 11.5 Continuously validate and recalibrate with real mission truth
- Maintain a validation harness against LRO/GRAIL SPICE truth products and mission-like scenarios [[40]](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/pds/data/lro-l-spice-6-v1.0/lrosp_1000/data/spk/spkinfo.txt), [[42]](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/pds/data/grail-l-spice-6-v1.0/grlsp_1000/aareadme.htm)
- Use filter–smoother diagnostics and residual tests to detect model mismatch early [[26]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150020827/downloads/20150020827.pdf), [[29]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20180003657/downloads/20180003657.pdf)

---

## 12) Key “do’s and don’ts” that most directly improve short-term effectiveness

**Do**
- Optimize architectures using **capacity**, not just visibility [[3]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Kim.pdf), [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf)
- Assume **non-Gaussian uncertainty** and multi-modality for angles-only cislunar custody [[23]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Bolden.pdf), [[24]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Cislunar-SSA/Iannamorelli.pdf)
- Treat reacquisition as a planning-under-uncertainty problem; measure **time-to-reacquire** and use planners like MCTS/POMDP where appropriate [[46]](https://keithlegrand.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Chaturvedi-2025-Information-Driven-Cislunar-Space-Object-Reacquisition.pdf)
- Fuse in **range/Doppler** whenever you can (radar sessions can be decisive) [[17]](https://www.kiss.caltech.edu/final_reports/NextGeneration-PlanetaryRadar-final%202025-09-19.pdf)
- Standardize data exchange early (TDM/ODM/CDM) and include provenance/quality fields so recipients can trust and act fast [[33]](https://ccsds.org/Pubs/503x0b2c1.pdf), [[9]](https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Conjunction-Data-Message-CDM-Specification-for-Traffic-Coordination-System-for-Space-Draft-TraCSS-Spec-001.pdf), [[72]](https://ccsds.org/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/9-6f599803174a64f5da08b9814720b5c4/2025/02/508x0p11.pdf)

**Don’t**
- Rely on a single sensor, a single orbit family, or a single phenomenology for persistence [[13]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2023/Poster/Badura.pdf), [[15]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09732)
- Trust long-propagated Gaussian covariances blindly; manage covariance shelf-life and use consistency diagnostics [[51]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Harris.pdf), [[26]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150020827/downloads/20150020827.pdf)
- Treat scheduling as an afterthought; it is part of the system design and dominates real performance [[11]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Cislunar-SSA/Fahrner.pdf), [[3]](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2024/Poster/Kim.pdf)

---

### If you want, I can turn this into:
1) a **reference architecture diagram** (data flows + message types),  
2) a **requirements matrix template** (metrics, thresholds, verification methods) tailored to your specific ROI (e.g., NRHO custody vs transfer corridor warning), and  
3) an **operational playbook** for “24–72 hour cislunar monitoring” (sensor allocation, triggers, and escalation paths) aligned with CCSDS/TraCSS products.
