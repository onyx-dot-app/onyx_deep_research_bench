============================================================

QUESTION:
Please investigate the influence of mass media on language, specifically the queer community of Japan. I am trying to see if the consumption of shoujo manga by queer Japanese young adults affects their pronoun use and sentence ending particles. Both grammatical categories are gendered in Japanese and a distinct pattern emerges in shoujo manga compared to majority use in society, so observing a minority group would give insight into the effect of media in personal expression.

RESEARCH TASKS (6 total):
  #1: Investigate (2020–2026) scholarship on how Japanese mass media (especially manga/anime) influences language use and self-presentation, focusing on mechanisms like indexicality, enregisterment, yakuwarigo/role language, stylization, audience design, and stance-taking. Identify any empirical studies linking manga/anime consumption to uptake of first-person pronouns (e.g., boku, ore, watashi, atashi, uchi) and sentence-final particles (yo, ne, wa, zo, ze, kashira, no, etc.), including evidence about youth speech and online communities.
  #2: Research sociolinguistic and media-studies literature (2015–2026) on queer communities in Japan (LGBTQ+, X-gender, nonbinary, trans, gender-nonconforming) and their Japanese linguistic practices: first-person pronouns, sentence-ending particles, style-shifting across contexts (queer spaces vs workplace/school vs family vs online), and ideologies about 'gendered Japanese'. Include ethnographies of queer speech, studies of 'onee kotoba', onna kotoba/otoko kotoba, and discussions of pronoun choice among queer and trans people.
  #3: Compile linguistic descriptions of shoujo manga dialogue and its gendered patterns (1990s–2026, with emphasis on current trends): first-person pronouns and sentence-final particles used by different character types (heroines, princes/androgynous boys, villains, adults), and in subgenres like BL-adjacent shoujo, yuri-adjacent works, and gender-neutral character stylizations. Note how these patterns differ from mainstream young-adult Japanese and how role language is deployed in manga.
  #4: Find empirical research (2010–2026) that directly examines whether manga/shoujo/BL/anime consumption influences Japanese speakers’ real-world usage or attitudes toward gendered first-person pronouns and sentence-final particles. Look for surveys, experiments, ethnographies, or longitudinal/online-corpus studies, including within LGBTQ+/queer communities or fandom spaces; extract methods, sample, key findings, and limitations.
  #5: Research best-practice methods and ethics (2020–2026) for studying queer language use in Japan: recruitment and sampling, privacy/safety concerns, handling sensitive identity data, informed consent in online/offline contexts, and mixed-method designs (corpus + interviews + participant observation). Include guidance for operationalizing 'media consumption', annotating Japanese pronouns and sentence-final particles, and statistical approaches for disentangling media influence from identity/style.
  #6: Investigate confounding/intersecting factors affecting Japanese pronoun and sentence-final particle choice in young adults (region/dialect like Kansai, class/education, workplace norms, online community norms, friend networks, other media like VTubers, dramas, games). Identify studies that model these factors, especially in relation to gender/sexuality and style-shifting, and note how they might be controlled in a study of shoujo manga consumption among queer youth.

ANSWER:
### 1) What counts as “gendered” pronouns and sentence-ending particles in Japanese—and why manga matters

In Japanese, *first-person forms* (self-reference; often called “first-person pronouns” in English descriptions) and *sentence-final particles / sentence-final forms* (SFPs; including particles and particle-like endings such as **wa**, **yo**, **ne**, **zo/ze**, **kashira**, **no**, **da yo**, etc.) are among the most socially salient resources for *indexing gendered personae*—not in a deterministic way, but as part of culturally circulated expectations about how “men,” “women,” and character types “sound.” Contemporary sociolinguistics stresses that these gender linkages are **ideological and prescriptive stereotypes** rather than simple reflections of what people “naturally” do in everyday life [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15935).

Manga—and shōjo manga in particular—matters because Japanese popular fiction makes systematic use of **yakuwarigo (role language)**: bundles of linguistic features conventionally tied to character types (gender, age, class/status, archetype). This is explicitly recognized in Japanese-language pedagogy and research communication: role language is described as especially effective in **manga/anime/film/folktales/novels**, with canonical examples like a “manly” **iku ze/zo** versus a “feminine” **iku wa (wa ne/wa yo)** [[2]](https://www.jpf.go.jp/j/project/japanese/teach/tsushin/research/201302.html). In other words, fiction supplies *highly learnable, repeatable mappings* between forms and social meanings.

For your question—whether **queer Japanese young adults’ consumption of shōjo manga affects their pronoun use and SFPs**—the key is to separate:

* **(a) what linguistic patterns exist in contemporary speech vs. in shōjo dialogue,**
* **(b) what queer communities actually do with these resources across contexts,**
* **(c) what mechanisms plausibly connect media exposure to personal linguistic stylization,**
* **(d) what evidence exists that such exposure *actually* predicts usage**, and
* **(e) how to design a study that can distinguish “media influence” from confounds**.

A crucial constraint from the research history: **direct, modern (2010–2026) causal evidence linking shōjo consumption to uptake of specific gendered 1st-person forms and SFPs among Japanese queer youth is limited**. What we do have is (i) strong theory and indirect evidence about media as a norm-reinforcing and stereotype-enregistering force, (ii) good descriptive/empirical work on pronouns/SFPs in real speech and online writing, (iii) empirical work on pronouns in popular manga corpora, and (iv) ethnographic/sociolinguistic work showing queer speakers’ strategic style-shifting—often precisely around these “gendered” features.

## 2) Baseline patterns in mainstream young(-ish) Japanese: what is changing, what is stable

### 2.1 Sentence-final forms: strong gendering is often *ideological*, and everyday usage is frequently “neutral-heavy”
Work on young adults repeatedly finds that **“neutral” endings dominate**, with only limited use of strongly gender-stereotyped particles—especially in casual peer talk.

* In recorded informal conversations among Tokyo female college students (18–20), Okamoto found **neutral forms ~69%**, “masculine” ~19%, “feminine” ~12% (and *strongly* feminine forms especially rare and often appearing in **quoted speech**) [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995). This already shows a common pattern: ordinary interaction is not saturated with stereotypical “women’s language,” and strongly feminine particles may be available more as *stylized* resources.
* More recently, Okamoto & Morimoto argue that public claims that gender differences are disappearing are often based on only **one or two salient features**, especially **SFPs and pronouns**. In their multi-feature analysis of college-student conversations, **sentence-final forms varied little by gender**, while other resources remained normatively gendered [[10]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569). This supports treating SFPs as *highly noticeable symbols* in ideology, but not necessarily the main site where gender difference “lives” in everyday talk.

In parallel, large-scale social media work suggests that these gendered markers are present but not overwhelming. Carpi & Iacus, analyzing enormous Japanese Twitter datasets (2015–2019), report gendered language (as operationalized by their pronoun/SFP token set) in about **6% of tweets**, with statistically significant differences by account gender and notable “switching patterns” that violate prescriptive expectations [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15935). Their framing is important for your project: Twitter-like writing is treated as “conversation-like” enough that SFPs and pronouns become visible as identity resources in public-yet-personal text [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15935).

### 2.2 First-person forms: more persistent gender-indexing, but growing repertoire variation and context sensitivity
A recurring claim in the literature is that **pronouns/self-reference remain more stable as gender-indexes** than SFPs, even amid broader shifts [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574). But the same body of work shows increasing repertoire size and strategic switching.

A particularly useful empirical anchor is Ojima’s comparison of women’s university students in **2001 vs 2011**, using both free response and addressee-controlled scenarios (teacher vs friend vs parent vs sibling). Key findings:

* Repertoires expanded: average self-reference terms per person increased (1.99 → 2.35) and “only one term” responses dropped sharply [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf).
* **Watashi** as the top choice dropped dramatically, while **uchi** rose sharply (top-choice *uchi* 4.0% → 32.1%) [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf).
* Addressee matters a lot, and by 2011 nearly everyone differentiated by context. For friends, *uchi* surged; for teachers, *watashi* stayed relatively high; with siblings, *jibun* and other forms appeared more [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf).

This matters for your question because it shows: even among non-queer-coded populations, *pronoun choice is not just “gender”*—it is **stance, addressee, role, and community practice**. Any “media effect” has to be tested against a background where **variation and switching are already normal** and historically changing.

### 2.3 The norms are taught—and that matters especially for LGBTQ+ speakers
Nakamura’s historical-discourse work shows that the “gendered pronoun norm” is not timeless: it was constructed through modernization, nationalism, and later reinforced through schooling and textbooks. Contemporary elementary education often explicitly instructs **girls → watashi**, **boys → boku**, thereby naturalizing a binary [[14]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Momoko-Nakamura/publication/378966537_The_formation_of_the_norm_of_gendered_first-person_pronouns_in_Japanese_KGU_Journal_of_Business_and_Liberal_Arts_4_21-47/links/65f3a67a1f0aec67e28fe82f/The-formation-of-the-norm-of-gendered-first-person-pronouns-in-Japanese-KGU-Journal-of-Business-and-Liberal-Arts-4-21-47.pdf). Nakamura argues this norm reinforces heteronormativity by forcing self-presentation as either “woman” or “man,” and documents LGBTQ+-relevant memoir anecdotes where being corrected for pronoun choice caused distress and alienation [[14]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Momoko-Nakamura/publication/378966537_The_formation_of_the_norm_of_gendered_first-person_pronouns_in_Japanese_KGU_Journal_of_Business_and_Liberal_Arts_4_21-47/links/65f3a67a1f0aec67e28fe82f/The-formation-of-the-norm-of-gendered-first-person-pronouns-in-Japanese-KGU-Journal-of-Business-and-Liberal-Arts-4-21-47.pdf).

This is central to your design: if queer young adults differ from mainstream peers, it may be because they are negotiating **institutional correction pressures**, not only because they read shōjo.

## 3) What shōjo manga dialogue actually does with pronouns and gendered endings (and what it may *not* do)

### 3.1 Shōjo dialogue is shaped by yakuwarigo/character-language logic
Kinsui’s yakuwarigo framing emphasizes that fiction links linguistic forms to social images (old professor, refined young lady, etc.) even when those forms are historically odd or rare in real life [[20]](https://dialogue.osaka-u.ac.jp/282/). A related “character language” approach makes the same point: small differences like **ore/boku/watashi/atashi** or **yo/zo/ze** can drastically change character impression; manga is a privileged site to observe systematic persona shifts across relational contexts [[22]](https://kansaigaidai.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/8128/files/n32_01.pdf).

### 3.2 Empirical corpus evidence from popular manga: gendered patterns are present, but some “folk beliefs” about influence are not supported by the input itself
Unser-Schutz’s corpus study is especially relevant because it was motivated by the widespread belief that manga influences young women to use masculine first-person forms. They built a large corpus from eight top-selling titles (four boy-oriented, four girl-oriented—including shōjo titles like *Kimi ni Todoke*, *Nana*, *Nodame*, *RabuKon*) and tagged utterances by speaker gender category [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574). Key findings:

* The central male 1st-person form was **ore**; the central female 1st-person form was **atashi** [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574).
* Male characters showed greater pronoun variety, including role-language forms like **washi** that are not common in contemporary youth speech [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574).
* **Crucially:** across these mainstream popular titles, the corpus found **no female characters using masculine first-person forms (boku/ore)**—despite popular discourse blaming manga for girls’ boku/ore use [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574).
* There *was* a notable reversal: a male character using **atashi** described as a “female-identifying transsexual” in *RabuKon* [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574)—showing that gender crossing can appear, but is character-typed and narratively marked.
* The corpus lacked **uchi** and **jibun** as first-person forms, even though other studies report them as common in real youth usage—suggesting manga may **lag** behind everyday innovation or reflect authors’ generational norms [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574).

For second-person forms, male lines favored **omae**, female lines favored **anta/anata**, with some “masculine” second-person usage by women tied to specific character types (e.g., punk Nana using **temee**) while still self-referring with feminine **atashi** [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574). That asymmetry is important: fiction can construct “tough femininity” by mixing *address* roughness with *self-reference* femininity.

### 3.3 Implication for your hypothesis
If your hypothesis is “shōjo consumption increases queer youths’ uptake of shōjo-like pronouns/SFPs,” you need to be very specific about *what shōjo input actually contains*:

* If mainstream shōjo often uses **atashi/watashi** and avoids strongly feminine SFPs in realistic settings (consistent with broader trends that strongly feminine particles are rarer among young women), then “shōjo influence” might manifest not as **wa/kashira** adoption, but as:
  * adoption of certain **stance patterns** (softeners, affective alignment, interpersonal “ne/yo” usage),
  * preference for **name self-reference** or avoidance of explicit self-reference (which manga can also model),
  * uptake of **stylized role-language** only in performative contexts (quoting, joking, online persona creation).

Unser-Schutz later summarizes survey evidence that many Japanese respondents *perceive* manga as influencing youth speech, while emphasizing that manga’s role in language change is **not well established** and that manga can become a scapegoat for “linguistic ailments” like girls’ boku/ore [[23]](https://comicsforum.org/2015/11/24/what-are-you-reading-approaches-and-reasons-for-looking-at-language-in-manga-by-giancarla-unser-schutz/). This supports treating “manga influence” as partly a **metapragmatic ideology** (people talk about manga as a cause), which itself can influence behavior via self-monitoring and policing.

## 4) What is known about queer Japanese pronoun/SFP practices and style-shifting

### 4.1 Queer speech styles are mediated and ideologically loaded: onē-kotoba as a key example
Itakura’s ethnography of Tokyo amateur gay volleyballers examines **onē-kotoba** (“queen’s language”) not as a media stereotype alone but as a lived practice used tactically. The study emphasizes that onē-kotoba is entrenched in media representations of gay men, is sometimes rejected as inauthentic or misogynistic parody, yet is used locally for intimacy management—allowing speakers to oscillate between discretion and disclosure [[9]](https://benjamins.com/catalog/japc.00071.ita). The key takeaway for your project: **queer styles can be both media-circulated and locally repurposed**, with usage patterned by interactional goals (affiliation, flirtation, privacy) rather than stable identity categories.

### 4.2 Empirical evidence on gay men’s first-person use: heterogeneity and domain/topic conditioning
A detailed conversation-based study of ten gay men in their 20s in Osaka (2.5 hours of dyadic talk + interviews) found:

* wide diversity of first-person forms;
* **atashi** appeared, but only for some speakers;
* one participant used **atashi exclusively when talking about gay-community topics**, while using **boku** when recounting a workplace episode—suggesting **domain-specific self-presentation** (gay-community identity vs public/professional identity) [[25]](https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/past-events/jk2012/JK22%28abst38%29.pdf).
* many participants used **ore** (six of ten; three exclusively), showing that “gay men = feminine pronouns” is false as a generalization [[25]](https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/past-events/jk2012/JK22%28abst38%29.pdf).
* one participant attributed **watashi** use to being influenced by an interlocutor’s onē-kotoba (an accommodation-like explanation) [[25]](https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/past-events/jk2012/JK22%28abst38%29.pdf).

This is extremely relevant to your shōjo question: it implies a plausible *parallel mechanism*—not “manga causes pronoun X,” but **contextual alignment with a community-coded register** that may be associated with certain media genres (shōjo, BL, queer media), and that is selectively deployed.

### 4.3 Trans and nonbinary/X-gender issues: pronoun norms as constraint, linguistic practice as embodied negotiation
Abe’s work explicitly treats trans women’s linguistic practice as tied to both embodied self and social expectations, rejecting essentialism and also challenging overly social-constructivist treatments [[13]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27159903). While the abstract does not list specific variables, it validates the idea that pronoun/SFP choices are part of lived gender negotiation, not just “style.”

Separately, Nakamura argues that gendered pronoun norms intensify difficulties for LGBTQ+ speakers because they compel binary self-presentation [[14]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Momoko-Nakamura/publication/378966537_The_formation_of_the_norm_of_gendered_first-person_pronouns_in_Japanese_KGU_Journal_of_Business_and_Liberal_Arts_4_21-47/links/65f3a67a1f0aec67e28fe82f/The-formation-of-the-norm-of-gendered-first-person-pronouns-in-Japanese-KGU-Journal-of-Business-and-Liberal-Arts-4-21-47.pdf). Even if a queer person avoids overt pronouns by using ellipsis (a well-known structural option in Japanese), the *moments when self-reference is needed* become socially consequential.

A journalistic but linguistically relevant observation is that Japanese often permits long stretches without overt pronouns, which can allow gender ambiguity in ways English does not [[16]](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2026/01/23/language/japanese-pronouns-nonbinary-language/). For queer young adults, this means “pronoun choice” is partly about **when to self-reference at all**—a design feature you should incorporate (e.g., measuring *rate of self-reference* as well as which form is chosen).

---

## 5) How mass media can influence language and self-presentation: the mechanisms most relevant to your study

Your research question is strongest when framed not as “do people copy manga,” but as “do people use media-enregistered resources as *indexical tools* for self-presentation—especially under minority identity conditions?”

### 5.1 Enregisterment and indexicality: forms become socially recognized “bundles”
Carpi & Iacus emphasize that gendered SFP/pronoun categories are ideological and prescriptive; people may reproduce or violate them, and switching patterns appear in Twitter writing [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15935). Okamoto & Morimoto show that a small set of salient features becomes “iconic” through metapragmatic typification—exactly how “women using men’s language” becomes a recurring moral panic [[10]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569). Sherwood et al. add that listeners associate gender with **prescriptive variables** more than with other types of variation, implying that enregistered forms are socially legible and thus powerful resources for persona-building (and for misrecognition) [[11]](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/ling-2022-0149/html).

Fictional media, via yakuwarigo, accelerates enregisterment: it repeatedly pairs particular endings with recognizable characters (refined lady, delinquent, prince-like boy), making the mappings easy to learn and easy to perform [[2]](https://www.jpf.go.jp/j/project/japanese/teach/tsushin/research/201302.html), [[20]](https://dialogue.osaka-u.ac.jp/282/), [[22]](https://kansaigaidai.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/8128/files/n32_01.pdf).

### 5.2 Stylization and “character language”: borrowing forms to build a self
The “character language” account explicitly treats pronouns and SFPs as *impression management devices*: ore/boku/watashi/atashi, yo/zo/ze, etc., shift how a speaker is perceived even when propositional meaning stays similar [[22]](https://kansaigaidai.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/8128/files/n32_01.pdf). Importantly, it also argues that **one person can perform multiple “characters”** depending on context—mirroring what queer speakers often do when shifting between queer spaces and mainstream institutions.

### 5.3 Media as norm reinforcement (not just innovation)
Media does not only supply alternatives; it also reinforces what counts as “normal” gender. Okamoto & Morimoto explicitly state media plays a significant role in reinforcing linguistic gender norms [[10]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569). Yoshida’s analysis of Japanese language textbooks shows heteronormativity remains dominant and that gendered features (including pronouns and SFPs) are part of how gender/sexuality ideologies are reproduced, with only limited incorporation of diversity across editions [[15]](https://utppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.1558/genl.23358). This parallels mainstream entertainment: even when queer characters appear, they may be stylized through enregistered speech types (e.g., onē-kotoba), which then circulate as stereotypes [[9]](https://benjamins.com/catalog/japc.00071.ita).

### 5.4 “Consumption → uptake” evidence: currently limited and must be tested carefully
Within the accessible research history, **direct empirical studies** that measure shōjo consumption intensity and predict actual pronoun/SFP usage are not well represented. The strongest manga-language corpus work [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574) actually undermines a simple imitation account by showing that female ore/boku is absent in those popular manga inputs. This does not prove “no effect,” but it suggests that if an effect exists, it is likely mediated by:

* identification with *male characters* across demographics,
* uptake of *stance styles* rather than the same pronoun tokens,
* selective uptake from *other genres* adjacent to shōjo (BL, games, VTubers, dramas) rather than shōjo narrowly,
* or uptake of *metapragmatic beliefs* (“this is how X people talk”) rather than direct copying.

## 6) Interpreting your specific hypothesis: what patterns would count as “shōjo influence” among queer young adults?

Because “shōjo language” is not one thing, it helps to break your hypothesis into testable sub-hypotheses.

### 6.1 Token-level uptake hypothesis (strong, easy to test, but may be false or context-limited)
**Prediction:** Higher shōjo consumption predicts increased use of shōjo-typical gendered tokens (e.g., **atashi**, feminine **wa/kashira/no yo**, etc.), or decreased use of stereotypically masculine tokens (**ore/zo/ze**).

**Problems:**
* Strongly feminine particles may be rare in mainstream youth speech and may not be dominant in realistic shōjo either (especially modern settings). Okamoto’s earlier work shows strongly feminine forms are rare and often appear in quoted speech among young women [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995).
* Unser-Schutz shows mainstream popular shōjo does not heavily feature gender-crossing pronouns for girls (no female boku/ore) and may omit some modern youth forms like uchi/jibun [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574). So the “input” may not support the expected direction.

### 6.2 Stance/style uptake hypothesis (often more plausible)
**Prediction:** Higher shōjo consumption predicts greater use of interactional patterns associated with shōjo romance dialogue—e.g., alignment work via **ne**, affective softening, relationship-indexing style shifts, more frequent quoting/role-play of stereotyped endings in playful contexts.

This aligns with:
* SFPs as stance markers [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15935),
* character-language/persona switching across relationships [[22]](https://kansaigaidai.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/8128/files/n32_01.pdf),
* queer speakers’ tactical switching between disclosure and discretion [[9]](https://benjamins.com/catalog/japc.00071.ita),
* gay men’s topic-conditioned switching (atashi in gay-community talk, boku in workplace talk) [[25]](https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/past-events/jk2012/JK22%28abst38%29.pdf).

### 6.3 Metapragmatic ideology hypothesis (often overlooked but powerful)
**Prediction:** Higher shōjo consumption predicts stronger beliefs that certain pronouns/SFPs “fit” certain genders/roles (or, conversely, stronger anti-normative stances), which then affects self-monitoring and selective performance.

This is consistent with:
* gendered norms being taught and policed via schooling [[14]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Momoko-Nakamura/publication/378966537_The_formation_of_the_norm_of_gendered_first-person_pronouns_in_Japanese_KGU_Journal_of_Business_and_Liberal_Arts_4_21-47/links/65f3a67a1f0aec67e28fe82f/The-formation-of-the-norm-of-gendered-first-person-pronouns-in-Japanese-KGU-Journal-of-Business-and-Liberal-Arts-4-21-47.pdf),
* gender policing being amplified through media commentary [[10]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569), [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995),
* prescriptive variables being socially salient in perception [[11]](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/ling-2022-0149/html).

For queer young adults, “influence” may operate through **conscious self-fashioning** (“I want to sound androgynous like X archetype”) or **avoidance strategies** (“I avoid watashi because it feels heterofeminine”), rather than direct copying.

## 7) Confounds you must handle (and how the literature suggests handling them)

A credible study of “shōjo consumption → pronoun/SFP choice” must separate shōjo from other forces that predict the same outcomes.

### 7.1 Region/dialect
Sentence-final items can be dialect-linked (e.g., Kansai endings) and dialect identity itself is a major identity resource. Even within this research history, dialect identity is flagged as central (e.g., Kansai identity negotiation work exists, though not accessible in full here) [[35]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24615146). Carpi & Iacus also note dialect-associated endings in their SFP inventory (e.g., Kansai forms like yan) [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15935). If queer participants disproportionately come from certain regions or online communities where certain dialect styles are fashionable, dialect can mimic “media influence.”

**Design implication:** either restrict to a dialect region (Okamoto-style control to Tokyo standard) [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995), or explicitly measure dialect background and include it as a predictor.

### 7.2 Cohort/time and general youth language change (e.g., rise of uchi)
Ojima’s 2001→2011 shift shows massive cohort effects unrelated to shōjo [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf). If your participants span ages 18–29, you may be mixing cohorts with different baseline norms.

**Design implication:** narrow age bands or model age as continuous; include “age at peak shōjo consumption” as a separate variable.

### 7.3 Addressee, setting, and institutional role (school/work vs queer space vs family)
Pronoun choice varies drastically by addressee (teacher vs friend vs parent vs sibling) [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf); gay men switch styles by topic/community vs workplace [[25]](https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/past-events/jk2012/JK22%28abst38%29.pdf); Itakura highlights discretion/disclosure pressures shaping style [[9]](https://benjamins.com/catalog/japc.00071.ita).

**Design implication:** collect multi-context data per person (peer talk, workplace/school talk, queer-space talk, online writing) and analyze **within-speaker switching** rather than only between-speaker averages.

### 7.4 Online community norms and “top-user” effects
Even though Brown’s computational work is not Japanese, it provides a relevant methodological warning: language norms in trans communities can be shaped by internal power dynamics and norm enforcement, and “top users” can disproportionately influence community language patterns [[39]](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/45d035nh). Japanese queer youth often participate in online spaces where language is memetically spread; that can look like “manga influence” but actually be “platform-community influence.”

**Design implication:** measure platform participation (X/Twitter, TikTok, Discord, etc.) and treat community membership as a predictor; consider network sampling.

### 7.5 Other media genres and adjacency (BL, games, VTubers, drama)
Even within manga/anime, shōjo is only one source of role-language exposure. Dahlberg-Dodd’s work on shōnen heroes shows pronoun patterns in popular anime shift historically and respond to societal masculinity rather than causing it [[24]](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstreams/cd9f03a2-74af-48ca-8869-109b0e294901/download), and her wa study shows media uses fine-grained characterological types (ojō-sama, gyaru, o-nee, etc.) [[5]](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstreams/19805a1d-86b1-478a-b6a4-39f4f80296ff/download). Queer youth may be influenced more by BL/yuri fandom speech norms, or by livestreamer styles, than by mainstream shōjo.

**Design implication:** measure media diet in a *genre-specific* way; “manga reader” is too coarse.

## 8) What we can responsibly conclude right now (from the available evidence)

### 8.1 Strong conclusions supported
1. **Pronouns and SFPs are culturally salient gender-indexical resources, but their gendering is ideological and often prescriptive** [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15935), and everyday young-adult usage is frequently “neutral-heavy” [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995), with gender identity constructed through multiple resources beyond SFPs [[10]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569).
2. **Manga/anime systematically deploy role language (yakuwarigo), explicitly including gendered SFPs**, making fiction a powerful enregisterment engine [[2]](https://www.jpf.go.jp/j/project/japanese/teach/tsushin/research/201302.html), [[20]](https://dialogue.osaka-u.ac.jp/282/), [[22]](https://kansaigaidai.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/8128/files/n32_01.pdf).
3. **Queer speakers in Japan demonstrably style-shift across contexts**, and pronoun choice can be topic/domain-conditioned (gay-community talk vs workplace talk) [[25]](https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/past-events/jk2012/JK22%28abst38%29.pdf), with onē-kotoba functioning as a tactical resource tied to media stereotypes but repurposed locally [[9]](https://benjamins.com/catalog/japc.00071.ita).
4. **Mainstream popular shōjo manga (in at least one major corpus study) does not provide much direct input of girls using masculine first-person forms**, undermining a simplistic “girls read manga → copy ore/boku” model [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574).
5. **Norm enforcement around pronouns is institutionally real (schools/textbooks)** and can create particular pressures for LGBTQ+ people [[14]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Momoko-Nakamura/publication/378966537_The_formation_of_the_norm_of_gendered_first-person_pronouns_in_Japanese_KGU_Journal_of_Business_and_Liberal_Arts_4_21-47/links/65f3a67a1f0aec67e28fe82f/The-formation-of-the-norm-of-gendered-first-person-pronouns-in-Japanese-KGU-Journal-of-Business-and-Liberal-Arts-4-21-47.pdf), [[15]](https://utppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.1558/genl.23358).

### 8.2 Claims that are *not* yet well demonstrated (and therefore are your research opportunity)
1. That **individual differences in shōjo consumption intensity** predict **measurable differences** in queer young adults’ real-world pronoun/SFP usage (beyond context, addressee, dialect, and community norms).
2. That any such differences are specifically traceable to **shōjo** rather than adjacent genres or platforms.
3. That the effect is **token-level** (specific pronouns/particles) rather than stance-level or ideology-level.

## 9) How to design a study that can answer your question convincingly

Below is a design that aligns with what the literature shows matters (context, ideology, switching, role language), and addresses the “missing link” problem (consumption → usage).

### 9.1 Sampling: queer Japanese young adults, but stratified by identity and context
Because “queer” is not a single community of practice, you’ll want strata (or at least metadata) such as: lesbian/bi women, gay/bi men, trans women, trans men, nonbinary/X-gender, gender-nonconforming cis people, plus degree of participation in queer spaces (offline and online). Abe’s work underscores that sexual minority linguistic strategies vary across contexts like bars, advice columns, texting, and private homes [[36]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9780230106161), so context is not optional.

**Recruitment caution:** community samples can overrepresent people already comfortable with linguistic/identity talk. Counterbalance by recruiting through multiple channels (community centers, university groups, online fandom spaces, general SNS).

### 9.2 Measure “shōjo consumption” in a way that matches mechanisms
Avoid a single “how much shōjo do you read?” item. Build a composite index:

* **Volume**: hours/week; number of titles/month; years of reading.
* **Recency**: current vs past consumption.
* **Engagement depth**: passive reading vs active participation (fan art, dōjin, cosplay, quoting lines, roleplay).
* **Subgenre exposure**: classic romance shōjo vs “school-life” vs fantasy; BL-adjacent shōjo; yuri-adjacent; titles with gender-nonconforming characters.
* **Character-identification**: self-reported identification with heroine vs prince-type vs androgynous boy vs villainess, etc. (This is crucial because role language is character-type linked [[20]](https://dialogue.osaka-u.ac.jp/282/), [[22]](https://kansaigaidai.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/8128/files/n32_01.pdf).)

### 9.3 Collect *observed language data* plus *metalinguistic ideology* data (triangulation)
Self-report alone is unreliable; Yee & Wong review concerns that people misreport pronoun use and that interview claims may contradict observed usage [[12]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216621002137). So you need both:

**A) Observed usage**
1. **Sociolinguistic interviews** (but treat them as one context, not “true speech”).
2. **Peer dyad recordings** (close friends) to capture casual style, like Okamoto’s design [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995).
3. **Contextual role-play / scenario elicitation** (teacher/friend/parent analogues), like Ojima [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf), but include queer-relevant addressees:
   * queer friend,
   * straight/cis coworker,
   * family member who doesn’t know,
   * partner/date,
   * online follower/audience.
4. **Online text corpus (optional but powerful)**: with consent, collect participants’ posts (X, Instagram captions, Discord logs). Carpi & Iacus show SFP/pronoun tokens can be meaningfully studied on Twitter-like platforms [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15935).

**B) Ideology and awareness**
1. Attitudes toward “gendered Japanese,” comfort with watashi/boku/ore/atashi/uchi/name, and beliefs about what sounds “masculine/feminine/neutral.”
2. Explicit questions about whether participants feel influenced by fiction—then treat this not as truth but as data about **folk models of influence** (which may mediate behavior) [[10]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569), [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995).

### 9.4 Annotation: go beyond “pronoun choice” to “self-reference strategy”
Because Japanese often omits subjects [[16]](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2026/01/23/language/japanese-pronouns-nonbinary-language/), track:
* overt self-reference tokens (watashi, atashi, boku, ore, uchi, jibun, name, nickname),
* **zero self-reference** where English would require “I,”
* plural first-person (uchira, etc.) if relevant.

For sentence-final features, code:
* particles (yo/ne/zo/ze/wa/kashira/no, etc.),
* copula style (da/desu/masu; “da yo” bundles),
* intonation notes if audio is available (important for wa, which can differ by intonation in characterological description [[5]](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstreams/19805a1d-86b1-478a-b6a4-39f4f80296ff/download)).

### 9.5 Analysis: model switching and context, not just averages
A strong approach is **multilevel modeling** (speaker as random effect; context as fixed effect; consumption indices as predictors; plus dialect, age, platform use, queer-space participation). Okamoto & Morimoto’s “multilevel” framing is conceptually aligned with this [[10]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569), and Ojima’s results show addressee context must be a central predictor [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf).

Key dependent variables could include:
* probability of choosing each self-reference form (multinomial),
* rate of overt self-reference vs omission,
* probability of using certain SFP bundles (e.g., zo/ze; wa; no; yo-ne combinations),
* degree of **cross-context divergence** per speaker (a “switching index”).

Then test whether shōjo consumption predicts:
1) baseline usage in any context,
2) or *increased switching* into certain styles in specific contexts (e.g., queer-space talk, playful online persona).

### 9.6 Establish what “shōjo-like” means empirically for *your* participants
Do not assume shōjo = wa/kashira. Use a two-step method:

1) Build a **reference corpus** of contemporary shōjo dialogue (and subgenres you care about) and compute pronoun/SFP distributions—Unser-Schutz shows corpus methods are feasible and can overturn assumptions [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574).
2) Derive a “shōjo-likeness” score for features that actually characterize your chosen shōjo subset, then test if participants’ speech shifts toward those features with higher consumption.

## 10) Ethics and participant safety (especially important in Japan)
Even without a dedicated Japan-specific ethics source in the accessible history, the queer-language studies summarized here make clear that disclosure/discretion is central to lived experience [[9]](https://benjamins.com/catalog/japc.00071.ita), and Nakamura documents how norms can harm LGBTQ+ individuals [[14]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Momoko-Nakamura/publication/378966537_The_formation_of_the_norm_of_gendered_first-person_pronouns_in_Japanese_KGU_Journal_of_Business_and_Liberal_Arts_4_21-47/links/65f3a67a1f0aec67e28fe82f/The-formation-of-the-norm-of-gendered-first-person-pronouns-in-Japanese-KGU-Journal-of-Business-and-Liberal-Arts-4-21-47.pdf). Therefore:

* **Minimize outing risk**: allow pseudonyms, avoid collecting identifying workplace/school details, carefully separate consent for recordings vs consent for quotes.
* **Context control**: do not require participants to bring partners/family; peer dyads should be chosen safely.
* **Online data**: treat SNS logs as highly sensitive; allow participants to select which posts to share; consider on-device extraction or participant-curated datasets.
* **Reporting**: avoid “exoticizing” queer speech as deviant; emphasize variability (as shown in gay men’s pronoun diversity) [[25]](https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/past-events/jk2012/JK22%28abst38%29.pdf).

---

## 11) What results would be most informative (and how to interpret them)

### If you find a shōjo-consumption effect on pronouns/SFPs
Interpretation should likely be **stylistic resource uptake** rather than deterministic change. A plausible pattern would be:

* higher shōjo engagement predicts greater **contextual stylization** (e.g., using certain endings in playful queer-space talk or online persona performance), not necessarily in workplace speech;
* the effect is mediated by **character identification** and **community practice**;
* ideology measures show that heavy shōjo consumers have stronger awareness of “how characters talk,” and they repurpose it.

This would align with yakuwarigo/character-language frameworks [[20]](https://dialogue.osaka-u.ac.jp/282/), [[22]](https://kansaigaidai.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/8128/files/n32_01.pdf), and with queer tactical switching for intimacy and disclosure management [[9]](https://benjamins.com/catalog/japc.00071.ita), [[25]](https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/past-events/jk2012/JK22%28abst38%29.pdf).

### If you *do not* find a direct effect
That would also be theoretically meaningful, and consistent with:

* manga possibly lagging behind real-world change for certain forms [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574),
* societal masculinity/femininity shifts shaping media rather than media shaping society (as argued for shōnen protagonist pronouns) [[24]](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstreams/cd9f03a2-74af-48ca-8869-109b0e294901/download),
* and the idea that pronoun/SFP choices are dominated by addressee/status/dialect and institutional norms rather than media diet [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995), [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf), [[14]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Momoko-Nakamura/publication/378966537_The_formation_of_the_norm_of_gendered_first-person_pronouns_in_Japanese_KGU_Journal_of_Business_and_Liberal_Arts_4_21-47/links/65f3a67a1f0aec67e28fe82f/The-formation-of-the-norm-of-gendered-first-person-pronouns-in-Japanese-KGU-Journal-of-Business-and-Liberal-Arts-4-21-47.pdf).

In that case, your most publishable contribution may be showing that “manga influence” is primarily:
* a **metapragmatic narrative** (people *say* manga influences speech) [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995), [[23]](https://comicsforum.org/2015/11/24/what-are-you-reading-approaches-and-reasons-for-looking-at-language-in-manga-by-giancarla-unser-schutz/),
* or an **ideological resource** used to explain/police deviation [[10]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569),
rather than a straightforward behavioral driver.

---

## 12) Bottom line for your research question
Your proposed focus—**queer Japanese young adults as a site to observe media influence on gendered pronouns and sentence-final particles**—is well motivated because queer speakers often engage in **conscious, tactical style work** under heteronormative constraints [[9]](https://benjamins.com/catalog/japc.00071.ita), [[14]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Momoko-Nakamura/publication/378966537_The_formation_of_the_norm_of_gendered_first-person_pronouns_in_Japanese_KGU_Journal_of_Business_and_Liberal_Arts_4_21-47/links/65f3a67a1f0aec67e28fe82f/The-formation-of-the-norm-of-gendered-first-person-pronouns-in-Japanese-KGU-Journal-of-Business-and-Liberal-Arts-4-21-47.pdf), and because manga/anime provide highly enregistered character-language templates [[2]](https://www.jpf.go.jp/j/project/japanese/teach/tsushin/research/201302.html), [[20]](https://dialogue.osaka-u.ac.jp/282/), [[22]](https://kansaigaidai.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/8128/files/n32_01.pdf).

But the strongest current evidence suggests you should expect **complex, context-dependent relationships**, not simple token copying:

* Pronoun choice is already shifting historically (e.g., *uchi* rise) and is strongly addressee-conditioned [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf).
* SFP gender differences can be small in everyday peer talk even when ideologies focus on them [[10]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569), [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995).
* Mainstream popular shōjo (in at least one substantial corpus) does not heavily model the specific “girls using ore/boku” pattern popularly blamed on manga [[21]](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574).
* Queer communities show both heterogeneity and strategic switching, including domain-conditioned pronoun use [[25]](https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/past-events/jk2012/JK22%28abst38%29.pdf) and tactical performance of enregistered queer styles tied to media stereotypes [[9]](https://benjamins.com/catalog/japc.00071.ita).

So the most promising version of your project is: **test whether shōjo consumption predicts (i) stance/persona stylization and (ii) cross-context switching patterns in pronouns and sentence-final resources, mediated by ideology and community participation**, while rigorously controlling dialect, age/cohort, addressee, and online community norms [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15935), [[31]](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/Okamoto1995), [[33]](https://ohka.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/44/files/04%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%8B.pdf), [[39]](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/45d035nh).

If you want, I can also draft (a) a concrete annotation scheme for pronouns + SFP bundles suited to Japanese audio and SNS text, and (b) an analysis plan (multilevel models + within-speaker switching metrics) tailored to sample sizes that are realistic for queer-community recruitment.
