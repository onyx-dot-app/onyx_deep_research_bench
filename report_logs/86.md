ANSWER:
### 1) NEV electric drive unit (EDU) hollow motor shaft: what the part must achieve, and what that implies for manufacturing

#### 1.1 Functional drivers for “hollow”
Hollow motor/rotor shafts are adopted mainly to:
- **Reduce mass and inertia** (better transient response, efficiency) and support lightweighting targets [[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652625003610).
- **Enable internal cooling paths** (oil routed through the shaft to cool rotor or magnets). A practical example explicitly describes rotor oil-cooling implemented via a hollow rotor shaft with internal oil flow [[64]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel8/6287639/6514899/11082312.pdf).
- **Increase thermal-management design freedom**; hollow architecture enables coolant flow and other internal features; EV rotor-shaft solutions explicitly highlight cooling via internal passages as a key benefit [[3]](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/), [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/), [[42]](https://www.productionmachining.com/articles/automated-high-production-welding-of-ev-rotor-shafts).

These drivers shift the manufacturing problem from “turn a solid shaft” to “make a high-precision thin‑wall rotating component that still has high fatigue strength and excellent balance at very high rpm.”

#### 1.2 Typical EDU rotor-shaft constraints (high-speed + tight electromagnetic clearances)
Key constraints that strongly influence process choice:

- **Very high rotational speed and balance sensitivity**  
  EV rotor shafts are described as operating at speeds as high as **~20,000 rpm**, where even small imbalance harms life [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/), [[42]](https://www.productionmachining.com/articles/automated-high-production-welding-of-ev-rotor-shafts).  
  In repair/acceptance guidance often used as a benchmark for rotating machines, default balancing guidance is **G2.5** up to 2500 rpm and **G1.0** above 2500 rpm when no other requirement is specified [[19]](https://brandonclark.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/EASA_AR100-2020_v0621.pdf), using ISO balance quality frameworks (ISO 1940-1) [[21]](https://www.dcma.mil/Portals/31/Documents/NPP/Forms/ISO_1940-1.pdf). Practical residual unbalance relations used with ISO grades are widely given as \(U_{per} = 9549 \cdot G \cdot m / n\) [[22]](https://rotorlab.tamu.edu/me459/Rotor%20Balancing/ISO%201940%20Balance%20quality%20requirements%20of%20rigid%20rotors%20.pdf), [[23]](https://www.cimat-balancing.com/faq/iso-21940-balance-quality-grades-g/).  
  **Implication:** processes that cause variable wall thickness, eccentricity, weld distortion, or high runout will create large cost in straightening, grinding, and/or balance correction.

- **Rotor/stator air-gap sensitivity → tight runout/concentricity**
  Air gap is one of the most sensitive dimensions; uneven gaps drive efficiency loss and unbalanced magnetic pull (noise/vibration) and risk rotor-stator rub under thermal growth and dynamic runout [[18]](https://www.gatorlamination.com/what-engineers-must-know-about-induction-motor-stator-and-rotor-tolerances/).  
  A concrete acceptance criterion commonly used for rotating electrical elements: **rotor core OD runout relative to bearing journals ≤ 5% of average radial air gap or 0.08 mm, whichever is smaller** [[19]](https://brandonclark.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/EASA_AR100-2020_v0621.pdf).  
  **Implication:** manufacturing route must control (or allow economical correction of) bearing journal concentricity vs. rotor seat features.

- **Bearing seat integrity and surface condition**
  Typical process chains for assembled EV rotor shafts include **hardening of bearing seats** and **final grinding** to achieve high surface finish [[16]](https://www.emag.com/industries-solutions/workpieces/assembled-rotor-shaft-electric-motor/).  
  Induction hardening is a standard way to increase surface hardness and fatigue strength (residual compressive stress + martensitic case), with typical induction austenitizing temperatures ~880–1050°C [[30]](https://www.asminternational.org/wp-content/uploads/files/16803145/16803145-preview.pdf).  
  Case depth/hardness targets are often specified (example case study: 42CrMo4 hollow shafts with surface hardness **58–62 HRC** and effective depth targets like ~2–3 mm class definitions) [[31]](https://www.aimnet.it/la_metallurgia_italiana/2025/luglioagosto/Aim_luglio-agosto2025_5.pdf).  
  **Implication:** even if near-net forming is used, most EDU shafts still require localized heat treat + grinding on journals, and the route must manage distortion.

- **Fatigue/torsion and notch sensitivity**
  Shaft fatigue is strongly influenced by near-surface condition. Mechanical surface treatments (shot peening / roller burnishing) improve fatigue primarily via compressive residual stress, but excessive roughness can reduce fatigue performance—heavy shot peening decreased high-cycle fatigue strength in tested steels, while improved surface condition (polish or burnishing) produced best results [[27]](https://www.shotpeener.com/library/pdf/2002061.pdf).  
  **Implication:** routes that deliver smooth surfaces (or that can be ground economically) and favorable residual stress are preferred.

- **Interfaces: splines/gears and rotor stack fits**
  Many EDU shafts include splined connections (to gearbox, differential, or coupling). Standards commonly referenced for involute splines include **ISO 4156** (module-based) [[74]](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/9921/e5c84452a1134654b8dede51d1d84e10/ISO-4156-1981.pdf) and **DIN 5480** (reference-diameter-based, 30° pressure angle; non-interchangeable with ISO 4156 families) [[75]](https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/files/209189/Spline_DIN_5480.pdf).  
  **Implication:** if splines are required, either (a) form them (internal/external) with mandrel-supported processes, or (b) machine them and accept cycle time/tooling cost.

- **Corrosion requirements depend on OEM specs**
  Salt spray testing is typically specified via ISO 9227 variants (NSS/AASS/CASS) for coated/uncoated corrosion protection verification, mainly as a quality consistency test rather than long-term prediction [[76]](https://www.iso.org/standard/63543.html), with well-known NSS boundary conditions (5% NaCl, ~35°C) described in practice guidance [[77]](https://erichsen.de/en/service/erichsen-academy/knowledge-base/corrosion-testing/salt-spray-test-according-to-din-en-iso-9227/).  
  **Implication:** most steel shafts rely on coatings for non-functional surfaces; bearing/spline surfaces usually rely on oil films + steel selection + surface hardening.

#### 1.3 Materials used (and what they imply)
Common material families for EDU shafts (based on what is explicitly evidenced in the gathered sources and what it implies):

- **Quench & temper (Q&T) alloy steels (e.g., 42CrMo4 / AISI 4140)**
  42CrMo4 is explicitly documented as ISO 683-2:2018 Q&T steel, suitable for induction hardening (surface hardness >53 HRC) [[29]](https://steelnavigator.ovako.com/steel-grades/42crmo4/), [[71]](https://www.lucefin.com/wp-content/files_mf/152353604042CrMo4.pdf).  
  **Implication:** excellent for shafts requiring high torsional strength + localized induction hardening on journals/splines; compatible with swaging, radial forging, flow forming, and machining.

- **Case-hardening steels (e.g., 18CrNiMo7-6)**
  18CrNiMo7-6 (ISO 683-3) supports carburizing with surface hardness typically **HRC ~60–63** (per datasheet) [[72]](https://www.lucefin.com/oaleekso/files_mf/152336766718CrNiMo76.pdf).  
  **Implication:** good for integrated gears/splines needing high wear resistance; but carburizing introduces distortion risk, strengthening the case for advanced distortion control (see §3.6).

- **Low-carbon steels (for strong cold-forming response / flow forming)**
  Flowformed EV rotor shafts are explicitly offered in **low-carbon steels** by a specialized supplier, with stated work hardening up to **2–3×** base strength [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/), [[3]](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/).  
  **Implication:** favorable for high-volume thin-wall shafts if strength comes from forming + localized hardening rather than bulk alloy cost.

- **Corrosion-resistant steels (niche)**
  17-4 PH stainless provides corrosion resistance roughly comparable to 304 in many environments, with SCC sensitivity depending on aging condition (H900 susceptible; higher aging temperatures resistant) [[78]](https://www.aksteel.nl/files/downloads/clf_datasheet_armco_17-4_ph_pdb_euro_102022_89.pdf).  
  **Implication:** possible for special environments, but cost and heat-treatment complexity usually limit use in mainstream EDU rotor shafts.

## 2) “All current forming techniques” for hollow motor shafts: a taxonomy (2023–2026 practice + emerging)

Below is a comprehensive process-family list covering (a) routes explicitly evidenced for motor/rotor shafts in the sources and (b) routes widely used for hollow shafts and actively discussed in 2023–2026 literature/equipment offerings (even when not exclusive to NEVs).

### 2.1 Tube-based starting stock routes (tube → forming/finishing)
1) **Precision tube supply + machining (turning, grinding, spline cutting, etc.)**  
   Precision tube suppliers explicitly market **tight tolerance tubes for EV rotor shafts**, noting advanced dimensional/geometric tolerance requirements at high rotational speeds and stating that renowned carmakers already source such tubes [[65]](https://www.mannesmann.com/en/transformation/e-mobility).

2) **Tube + end forming/necking (tube-necking, local reductions) + machining**  
   (Often combined with swaging/radial forging/flow forming for local geometry.)

3) **Tube-in-tube / trapped internal cooling tube architectures** (manufacturing-enabled design)  
   A documented EV rotor shaft option starts from a tubular preform and reduces/neck downs to “trap” an inner tube to form defined coolant flow paths [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/).

4) **Seamless tube manufacturing as upstream enabler** (piercing + mandrel mills/pilger etc.)  
   While not “shaft forming” itself, it is essential to tube-based shaft routes:
   - Cross-roll piercing and mandrel/assel/push-bench chains are documented for achieving thin walls and improved wall thickness quality [[4]](https://www.sms-group.com/plants/seamless-tube-plants).  
   - Cold pilger is highlighted as delivering closer tolerances and high reduction ratios (up to 80%) [[68]](https://www.sms-group.com/pt-br/insights/all-insights/next-successful-seamless-tube-production-and-partnership-milestone-marked-with-mannesmann-stainless-tubes).

### 2.2 Solid billet routes (solid → hole-making)
5) **Solid forging + deep-hole drilling / gun drilling**  
   Still common where internal geometry is simple and volumes justify machining. A machining supplier explicitly notes EV shafts are becoming hollow and this drives increased need for deep hole drilling; gun drilling is used to achieve high straightness for dynamic balance [[17]](https://tungaloy.com/industries/automotive_ev-motor-shaft/).

6) **Solid machining + deep-hole drilling** (when forging not required)

### 2.3 Hollow forging / piercing routes (hot)
7) **Hot piercing / mandrel piercing + forging to hollow preform**  
   Piercing is emphasized as critical to seamless hollow quality and wall tolerance [[4]](https://www.sms-group.com/plants/seamless-tube-plants). Patented methods exist for near-net hollow shafts via punching/piercing hollow preforms and subsequent heat treatments and machining [[6]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9446445B2/en) (not NEV-specific, but relevant).

### 2.4 Rolling-based near-net forming (high productivity, higher tooling)
8) **Cross-wedge rolling (CWR) of hollow billets for hollow motor shafts**  
   CWR is presented as efficient and material-saving for motor shafts; a 2024 publication focuses specifically on CWR design for **hollow motor shaft** billets and notes hollow billets help avoid central defects typical of CWR (Mannesmann effect issues) [[39]](https://mrforum.com/product/9781644903254-14/).  
   CWR defect modes (general): end concavity, spiral grooves, necking, central cracking [[53]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924013623002510).

9) **Skew rolling / three-roll skew rolling for hollow shafts with constant wall thickness**  
   2024 research proposes three-roll skew rolling to form hollow shafts with constant wall thickness and improved temperature uniformity, positioned as reducing process length and improving formability [[1]](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/6/702).

### 2.5 Swaging / radial forging (incremental forming; strong for axisymmetric hollow parts)
10) **Rotary swaging (cold or hot; with/without mandrel)**  
   Equipment suppliers describe high-frequency incremental forming (>1000 strokes/min) with broad geometry freedom and suitability for thin-walled tubes and high-strength materials [[37]](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/).  
   Quantified capability (supplier/agent): OD tolerance **0.01–0.1 mm**, ID tolerance **~0.03 mm on mandrel**, surface roughness down to **Ra ~0.1 μm** (recess swaging) [[67]](https://strecon.com/userfiles/file/Dokumenter/STRECON%20FELSS%20Rotary%20Swaging%20Machine.pdf).  
   Academic validation (motor rotor shaft class, railway traction): hot rotary swaging produced a 635 mm long, Φ105 mm max OD hollow motor shaft with **>30% weight reduction**, and showed strength/property changes after Q&T [[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652625003610).

11) **Radial forging** (closely related incremental process; often 4-hammer)  
   Radial forging is explicitly positioned for **EV rotor shafts**, which are often “hollow & bottle-shaped,” internally difficult to machine, and often require semi-hot forming ~700–850°C due to material/strength demands [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/). It is also positioned as enabling complex internal contours with mandrels, including internal splines in one operation [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/).

### 2.6 Flow forming / spinning family (mandrel-based thin-wall forming)
12) **Flow forming (cold) of tubular/forged preforms**  
   Flow forming is explicitly used for EV rotor shafts, with documented design variants (one-piece, two-piece, cooling features, internal fins) [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/), [[3]](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/).  
   Independent process descriptions highlight thin-wall capability (down to ~1 mm walls with ~0.1 mm deviation depending on setup/material) and very fine internal surface finish replication from the mandrel (Ra ~0.6 μm typical for interior) [[50]](https://astforgetech.com/flow-forming-a-complete-overview/).

13) **Metal spinning / shear spinning / flow-turning variants**  
   Mentioned in literature context for hollow motor shafts with enclosed cavities (spinning used to reduce cost for hollow structures per cited literature summaries) [[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652625003610). (Primary benchmark data not captured in provided sources.)

### 2.7 Extrusion-based routes (limited direct NEV evidence in the captured set)
14) **Backward/forward extrusion to form hollow shafts**  
   Cited as a known method for hollow motor shafts in the rotary swaging paper’s literature review [[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652625003610) (details not in captured sources).

### 2.8 Joining-based “hollowing” (multi-piece assembly)
15) **Laser-welded assembled hollow rotor shafts (two-piece or multi-piece)**
   This is one of the most clearly evidenced industrial routes for EV rotor shafts:
   - Two flowformed half shafts laser-welded in the center [[3]](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/).  
   - Multi-piece options: flowformed shaft + machined cap laser-welded [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/).  
   - High-volume production cells for circumferential laser welding are described, with an example claim of up to **500,000 rotors/year** capacity for an automated system [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/); the cell includes cleaning, induction preheat, seam tracking, pyrometer monitoring, and welding with minimized distortion [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/), [[42]](https://www.productionmachining.com/articles/automated-high-production-welding-of-ev-rotor-shafts).  
   - Another documented line concept: welded raw parts → inside/outside machining → cleaning → laser welding → hardening bearing seats → finishing & grinding [[16]](https://www.emag.com/industries-solutions/workpieces/assembled-rotor-shaft-electric-motor/).

16) **Rotary friction welding (tube-to-end, dissimilar possible)**
   Rotary friction welding machines are offered up to very high forge capacities (up to ~400 t class) [[43]](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/products/production-machines/rotary-friction-welding-machines/thompson).  
   Supplier examples show joining tube to solid ends to avoid extensive drilling and to create hollow centers [[8]](https://teamafw.com/friction-welding-projects/).  
   For inspection, UT/TOFD methods are documented for friction weld integrity, with TOFD enabling full volume inspection in a single pass and good repeatability [[56]](https://sonatest.com/download_file/force/df2a610a-1c73-4382-8fe0-0005dde8006e/456).  
   (Direct NEV shaft case benchmarks weren’t captured, but the route is mature in automotive and directly applicable.)

17) **Electron-beam (EB) welding** (joining-based; niche)
   EB welding is referenced alongside laser welding for axisymmetric automotive parts such as gear/rotor parts [[57]](https://blog.eddyfi.com/en/automated-phased-array-inspection-of-laser-and-electron-welds-in-the-automotive-industry). (No EDU-specific quantified data in captured set.)

### 2.9 Casting routes (generally less favored for high-speed shafts, but technically possible)
18) **Centrifugal casting (hollow cylindrical preform) + machining/heat treat**
   Centrifugal casting process chain includes mold prep → rotation/pour → outside-in solidification → machining/finishing; impurities concentrate at ID and are removed by machining; QC often includes UT/RT/PT and mechanical tests [[61]](https://www.fuchuncasting.com/centrifugal-casting-the-ultimate-guide/).  
   HIP can be used to remove porosity in castings and improve fatigue scatterband [[11]](https://www.bodycote.com/hot-isostatic-pressing/).

### 2.10 Powder metallurgy / HIP near-net routes (niche for shafts; strong for complex shapes in high-value alloys)
19) **PM-HIP / near-net-shape HIP (capsule HIP) producing hollow bars or near-net components**
   HIP is documented as enabling hollow bars (including multiple inner diameters) and complex near-net shapes with reduced machining and welding [[11]](https://www.bodycote.com/hot-isostatic-pressing/).  
   NNS-HIP is recognized for high material utilization and microstructure uniformity [[12]](https://ceramics.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jace.20196).  
   PM-HIP maturity is described across industries; benefits include isotropic properties and ultrasonic inspectability due to fine grain structures [[62]](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2216/ML22164A438.pdf), [[63]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1915241).  
   Risk: prior particle boundary (PPB) networks can create planes of weakness if not controlled [[63]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1915241).

### 2.11 Additive manufacturing (emerging; usually not for mass-produced shafts)
20) **Metal AM (often with HIP + machining)**
   AM is presented as enabling lightweight automotive PMSM rotor/shaft concepts with integrated air-cooling, with a reported rotor+shaft mass reduction (33%) and inertia reduction (13%) versus a conventional reference motor in a cited concept summary [[13]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373729491_Additively_manufactured_air-cooled_lightweight_rotor_for_an_automotive_electric_motor).  
   HIP is explicitly stated as able to eliminate internal voids in AM parts [[11]](https://www.bodycote.com/hot-isostatic-pressing/).  
   (Production shaft adoption remains limited in the captured sources; AM is mainly a design enabler for complex internal cooling/topology.)

### 2.12 Hybrid / composite-like approaches (mostly metal-metal in practice here)
21) **Dissimilar-material joints / diffusion bonding / cladding**
   HIP diffusion bonding and cladding are documented capabilities for creating metallurgical bonds and applying thick wear/corrosion claddings [[11]](https://www.bodycote.com/hot-isostatic-pressing/).  
   Friction welding examples include dissimilar combinations (e.g., nickel alloy to DOM tube) [[8]](https://teamafw.com/friction-welding-projects/).  
   (Not commonly documented for mainstream EDU shafts in the captured set, but technically feasible.)

---

## 3) End-to-end process chains: what each route typically needs downstream (machining, heat treat, straightening, inspection)

Because EDU shafts have bearing journals, seal surfaces, rotor stack fits, and balance requirements, **almost every route ends with precision machining/grinding + balancing**, even if the hollow is formed near-net.

Below, “required subsequent steps” are grouped into (a) typical operations and (b) route-specific needs.

### 3.1 Tube + machining route (precision tube as blank)
**Typical chain**
1) Seamless/precision tube supply (often cold pilger or mandrel-mill based upstream) [[4]](https://www.sms-group.com/plants/seamless-tube-plants), [[68]](https://www.sms-group.com/pt-br/insights/all-insights/next-successful-seamless-tube-production-and-partnership-milestone-marked-with-mannesmann-stainless-tubes)  
2) Cut-to-length, straightening (tube plants include straightening/testing stages) [[46]](https://www.steeljrv.com/how-to-make-seamless-steel-pipe.html)  
3) Turning/milling for features; internal finishing if needed  
4) Heat treatment (Q&T or case harden depending on steel)  
5) Local surface hardening (often induction hardening of bearing seats) [[16]](https://www.emag.com/industries-solutions/workpieces/assembled-rotor-shaft-electric-motor/), [[30]](https://www.asminternational.org/wp-content/uploads/files/16803145/16803145-preview.pdf)  
6) Final grinding of journals; finish operations (possible honing of ID if functional)  
7) Balance to ISO grade per OEM requirement (ISO 1940-1 framework) [[21]](https://www.dcma.mil/Portals/31/Documents/NPP/Forms/ISO_1940-1.pdf), commonly G1.0 class for high speed in generic guidance [[19]](https://brandonclark.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/EASA_AR100-2020_v0621.pdf)  
8) NDT as required (UT for tube integrity upstream; final inspections)

**Pros/cons**
- Excellent raw material utilization vs drilling-from-solid; but depends on tube quality (wall tolerance, straightness).
- Very mature supply chain: tube supplier explicitly states OEM adoption for EV rotor shafts [[65]](https://www.mannesmann.com/en/transformation/e-mobility).

### 3.2 Solid forging + deep-hole drilling (gun drilling) route
**Typical chain**
1) Forge/heat treat as needed  
2) Deep-hole drilling (gun drilling for highest straightness, linked to dynamic balance needs) [[17]](https://tungaloy.com/industries/automotive_ev-motor-shaft/)  
3) Turning/milling, spline/gear cutting  
4) Surface hardening (induction or carburize)  
5) Final grinding and balancing

**Key risks**
- **Cost and time** of drilling; tool wear; chip evacuation; bore straightness and concentricity strongly affect balance.
- Often used when internal geometry is simple and volumes are moderate, or when forging properties are mandatory.

### 3.3 Flow forming route (tube/forged preform → flowform → machining; optionally assemble)
**Documented EV rotor-shaft chain variants**
- “Forged preform → flowformed → machined” [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/).  
- Flowformed half-shafts → **laser weld** into longer hollow rotor shaft [[3]](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/).  
- One-piece flowformed shaft with **inserted cooling tube** and end reductions that “trap” the tube [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/).  
- Internal fins integrated to increase internal surface area up to 70% (cooling benefit) [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/).

**Typical downstream steps**
- Local machining of bearing journals, shoulders, rotor stack seats.
- Heat treat strategy depends on steel: for low-carbon flowformed shafts, properties partly come from work hardening [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/), [[3]](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/), but bearing seats still often hardened/ground.
- If assembled: weld inspection + runout correction (grind after weld), then balancing.

**Notable capability evidence**
- EV rotor shaft flowforming offering cites formed diameters ±0.10 mm and runout between IDs 0.05 mm [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/) (still typically not enough alone for final bearing seats → grinding is common).

### 3.4 Rotary swaging / radial forging route
**Rotary swaging**
- Supplier capability: OD tolerance 0.01–0.1 mm; ID tolerance ~0.03 mm on mandrel; surface roughness down to Ra ~0.1 μm [[67]](https://strecon.com/userfiles/file/Dokumenter/STRECON%20FELSS%20Rotary%20Swaging%20Machine.pdf).  
- Academic motor-shaft example chain: forged 42CrMo rod → deep-hole drilling → multiple hot rotary swaging passes to form near-enclosed cavity → precision machining → Q&T (property improvement reported) [[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652625003610).

**Radial forging (EV rotor shafts)**
- Positioned for bottle-shaped hollow shafts with internal contours, often semi-hot 700–850°C for formability in high-strength materials [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/).  
- With mandrels can form multi-stepped internal contours and even internal splines in one operation [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/).

**Downstream needs**
- Heat treatment (Q&T and/or induction hardening). 42CrMo4 is explicitly compatible with induction hardening [[29]](https://steelnavigator.ovako.com/steel-grades/42crmo4/), [[30]](https://www.asminternational.org/wp-content/uploads/files/16803145/16803145-preview.pdf).  
- Grinding of bearing seats and critical diameters.
- Potential straightening depending on distortion/residual stresses.

**Special note on residual stresses/surface**
Rotary swaging parameters influence roundness and roughness; higher feed velocity and dry forming increased roundness deviation and roughness in one study [[51]](https://www.matec-conferences.org/articles/matecconf/pdf/2018/49/matecconf_icnft2018_04001.pdf). This matters for bearing seats and balance.

### 3.5 Cross-wedge rolling / skew rolling route
**Typical chain (conceptual)**
1) Start with hollow billet (to mitigate central defect risk) [[39]](https://mrforum.com/product/9781644903254-14/)  
2) CWR to near-net stepped hollow shaft billet  
3) Heat treat  
4) Machining/grinding of journals and features  
5) Balance

**Quality focus**
- CWR is prone to central cracking (Mannesmann effect), necking, end defects; CT/X-ray NDT has been used to detect longitudinal internal cracks in rolled preforms [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6678906/), and common defect categories are documented [[53]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924013623002510).  
- This implies a potentially heavier NDT burden than flowforming/swaging for safety-critical high-speed shafts unless process is very mature and tightly controlled.

### 3.6 Joining-based assembled hollow shafts (laser welding; friction welding)
**Laser-welded two-piece EV rotor shafts (high-volume)**
A representative industrial chain:
- Machine each half (including internal geometry) → clean → laser weld circumferential seam → harden bearing seats → finish internal/external geometry → final grinding [[16]](https://www.emag.com/industries-solutions/workpieces/assembled-rotor-shaft-electric-motor/).  
High-volume laser welding systems for circumferential seams integrate cleaning, induction preheating, seam tracking (multi-point around circumference), pyrometer control, and process strategies to minimize distortion [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/), [[42]](https://www.productionmachining.com/articles/automated-high-production-welding-of-ev-rotor-shafts).

**Friction welding (tube-to-solid ends)**
- Used to avoid extensive drilling and to create hollow centers by joining tube and forged/machined ends [[8]](https://teamafw.com/friction-welding-projects/).  
- NDT: UT pulse echo and TOFD are established; TOFD can inspect full weld volume in one pass with good repeatability [[56]](https://sonatest.com/download_file/force/df2a610a-1c73-4382-8fe0-0005dde8006e/456).  
- Equipment is available at large forging forces for automotive-scale parts [[43]](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/products/production-machines/rotary-friction-welding-machines/thompson).

**Why joining is attractive for EDU shafts**
- Lets you put **high-strength, hardenable steel “where it matters”** (journals, spline ends) and keep the midsection as thin-wall tube for low inertia.
- Enables complex internal cooling geometry on subcomponents before joining (explicitly cited as a major advantage of assembled shafts) [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/), [[42]](https://www.productionmachining.com/articles/automated-high-production-welding-of-ev-rotor-shafts).

### 3.7 Distortion control and heat treatment (cross-cutting requirement)
EDU components are sensitive to distortion because post-heat-treat hard machining is expensive and threatens throughput. Advanced distortion control using **low-pressure carburizing + high-pressure gas quenching** is highlighted as reducing distortion and cost, especially for e-drive components; more uniform heat transfer in gas quenching improves predictability and can reduce or eliminate press quenching and reduce hard machining load [[44]](https://gearsolutions.com/features/advanced-distortion-control-for-case-hardening-of-transmission-components/).  
Even when shafts are not carburized, the general principle—tight distortion control to minimize post-HT correction—applies strongly to high-speed rotor shafts.

### 3.8 Inspection / NDT (route-dependent)
- **Forgings:** typical sequences emphasize visual + MPI/PT and UT after final heat treatment and machining suitable for UT, and prior to drilling bores and prior to surface hardening in many forging specs [[47]](https://www.irclass.org/media/3362/cn-ndt-exam-hull-mch-steel-forgings.pdf).  
- **CWR parts:** X-ray/CT has been used to detect internal cracks in preforms [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6678906/).  
- **Laser/EB welds on axisymmetric parts:** immersion phased-array UT is described for radial beam inspection while rotating the part; single rotation can cover weld volume with high productivity [[57]](https://blog.eddyfi.com/en/automated-phased-array-inspection-of-laser-and-electron-welds-in-the-automotive-industry).  
- **Friction welds:** UT and TOFD are established; TOFD provides full-volume inspection in one pass [[56]](https://sonatest.com/download_file/force/df2a610a-1c73-4382-8fe0-0005dde8006e/456).  
(Actual OEM acceptance criteria are typically proprietary; the above describes proven method options.)

### 4.2 Key trade-offs (what matters most for EDU shafts)

#### A) Controlling runout and balance at scale
- **Best-positioned routes** are those that naturally maintain concentricity via mandrels and/or allow final correction economically: flow forming (mandrel), rotary swaging with mandrel, radial forging with mandrel, and assembled shafts that are ground after welding [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/), [[16]](https://www.emag.com/industries-solutions/workpieces/assembled-rotor-shaft-electric-motor/), [[67]](https://strecon.com/userfiles/file/Dokumenter/STRECON%20FELSS%20Rotary%20Swaging%20Machine.pdf).

#### B) Minimizing machining while still achieving bearing-seat quality
- Forming routes can reduce bulk machining, but **bearing journals almost always still require hardening + grinding** for surface finish and tolerance (explicit in assembled rotor shaft lines) [[16]](https://www.emag.com/industries-solutions/workpieces/assembled-rotor-shaft-electric-motor/).  
- Rotary swaging can achieve very fine surfaces (Ra ~0.1 μm in recess swaging) and tight ID control (0.03 mm on mandrel) [[67]](https://strecon.com/userfiles/file/Dokumenter/STRECON%20FELSS%20Rotary%20Swaging%20Machine.pdf), which can reduce finishing on some diameters, but journals typically still get ground for bearing fits.

#### C) Managing distortion from heat treatment
- If carburizing is used (geared ends, splines), distortion control becomes pivotal; modern LPC + HPGQ is highlighted as a distortion-reduction route with cost advantages for e-drive components [[44]](https://gearsolutions.com/features/advanced-distortion-control-for-case-hardening-of-transmission-components/).

#### D) Risk and inspection cost
- Routes with higher internal defect risk (notably some rolling routes like CWR with Mannesmann-effect cracking) may require more aggressive NDT (e.g., CT/X-ray demonstrated) [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6678906/), while welded routes demand weld inspection (PAUT/TOFD) [[57]](https://blog.eddyfi.com/en/automated-phased-array-inspection-of-laser-and-electron-welds-in-the-automotive-industry), [[56]](https://sonatest.com/download_file/force/df2a610a-1c73-4382-8fe0-0005dde8006e/456).  
- Forming routes like flow forming and swaging tend to have fewer “hidden” internal cracking modes than CWR for the same geometry, but they still require strict control.

## 5) What is “most suitable” for hollow motor shafts in NEV EDUs? Recommended manufacturing routes (by use case)

No single process wins for all designs. The best routes depend on: (i) volume, (ii) internal cooling complexity, (iii) whether splines/gears are integrated, (iv) material/heat treat strategy, and (v) how aggressively mass must be minimized.

### 5.1 High-volume mainstream passenger NEV EDU rotor shafts (thin-wall hollow + very high rpm)
**Most suitable primary routes**

1) **Flow forming of preforms + finish machining; optionally two-piece + laser welding**
- Strong direct EV rotor-shaft evidence: flowformed EV rotor shafts with integrated cooling options, two-piece laser-welded architecture, and quantified runout/tolerance capability [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/), [[3]](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/).  
- Assembled two-piece approach is explicitly positioned for EV rotor shafts to enable hollow internal cooling channels and to reduce material cost; high-volume automated laser welding cells with seam tracking and distortion minimization are documented [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/), [[42]](https://www.productionmachining.com/articles/automated-high-production-welding-of-ev-rotor-shafts).  
- A full manufacturing line concept includes machining → cleaning → laser welding → hardening bearing seats → grinding for final finish [[16]](https://www.emag.com/industries-solutions/workpieces/assembled-rotor-shaft-electric-motor/).  
**Why it fits:** excellent lightweight potential, strong design freedom for cooling, very scalable automation.

2) **Rotary swaging (mandrel-supported) or radial forging for monoblock hollow shafts**
- Rotary swaging offers tight ID control on mandrels (~0.03 mm) and excellent surface finishes (Ra down to 0.1 μm) in supplier capability statements [[67]](https://strecon.com/userfiles/file/Dokumenter/STRECON%20FELSS%20Rotary%20Swaging%20Machine.pdf), with high-frequency productivity [[37]](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/).  
- Radial forging is explicitly marketed for EV rotor shafts that are hollow and bottle-shaped, often requiring semi-hot 700–850°C forming; it supports complex internal contours and even internal splines in one operation [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/).  
**Why it fits:** strong for monoblock designs (no weld seam), robust mechanical properties, strong automotive equipment maturity [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/).

**When to prefer flowformed + welded vs monoblock forged/swaged**
- Prefer **two-piece welded** when you need **complex internal cooling geometry** or internal features that are easier to machine on open halves before joining [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/), [[42]](https://www.productionmachining.com/articles/automated-high-production-welding-of-ev-rotor-shafts).  
- Prefer **monoblock** when weld risk/inspection cost is unacceptable, when stiffness/critical-speed requirements prefer no mid-span weld, or when internal features can be formed with mandrels (radial forging/swaging) [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/), [[37]](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/).

### 5.2 Shafts with integrated splines/gears or high wear surfaces
**Most suitable routes**
- **Radial forging with mandrels (semi-hot) to integrate internal splines** where feasible [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/).  
- **Assembled approach:** tube midsection + forged/machined ends joined by **friction welding** (or laser welding where appropriate), then case harden/induction harden ends and grind. This is strongly supported by friction-welding applicability to tube-to-solid joints [[8]](https://teamafw.com/friction-welding-projects/) and weld inspection readiness (UT/TOFD) [[56]](https://sonatest.com/download_file/force/df2a610a-1c73-4382-8fe0-0005dde8006e/456).  
- **Carburizing steels** (e.g., 18CrNiMo7-6) provide high surface hardness ~60–63 HRC after carburizing [[72]](https://www.lucefin.com/oaleekso/files_mf/152336766718CrNiMo76.pdf), but require strong distortion control; LPC + HPGQ is explicitly positioned as reducing distortion and cost for e-drive components [[44]](https://gearsolutions.com/features/advanced-distortion-control-for-case-hardening-of-transmission-components/).

### 5.3 Cost-driven, moderate lightweighting, simpler internal geometry (cooling not required or minimal)
**Most suitable routes**
- **Precision tube + machining** is compelling where internal geometry is simply a bore and the tube supply chain can meet tight tolerance needs; this route is explicitly marketed for EV rotor shafts by precision tube suppliers [[65]](https://www.mannesmann.com/en/transformation/e-mobility).  
- Compared with deep-hole drilling from solid, tube-based blanks avoid drilling time and help mass reduction.

### 5.4 Emerging / conditional routes (use selectively)
- **Cross-wedge rolling of hollow billets** can be very efficient and material-saving and is being actively developed for hollow motor shafts [[39]](https://mrforum.com/product/9781644903254-14/), but central cracking risk (Mannesmann effect) is well documented [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6678906/), [[53]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924013623002510). For high-speed EDU shafts, adopt only when process capability and NDT strategy are fully proven.  
- **PM-HIP and AM** are best kept for niche high-value variants (complex internal channels, special alloys) due to cost and qualification burden, despite strong design freedom and HIP’s ability to eliminate voids [[11]](https://www.bodycote.com/hot-isostatic-pressing/), [[13]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373729491_Additively_manufactured_air-cooled_lightweight_rotor_for_an_automotive_electric_motor), [[63]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1915241).

## 6) Practical selection framework (what to choose, and why)

A robust EDU shaft route choice can be made by scoring each candidate against these decision pillars, with the strongest weight typically on **(1) rotordynamics quality**, **(2) cost at volume**, and **(3) thermal/cooling integration**:

1) **Rotordynamics quality:** runout vs journals, thickness symmetry, weld distortion, straightness → drives balancing cost and NVH risk [[19]](https://brandonclark.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/EASA_AR100-2020_v0621.pdf), [[18]](https://www.gatorlamination.com/what-engineers-must-know-about-induction-motor-stator-and-rotor-tolerances/), [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/).  
2) **Cooling architecture:** internal oil path, fins, tube-in-tube, sealing features [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/), [[64]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel8/6287639/6514899/11082312.pdf).  
3) **Mechanical performance:** fatigue/torsion, surface integrity; benefit from induction hardening and surface treatments; manage roughness effects [[30]](https://www.asminternational.org/wp-content/uploads/files/16803145/16803145-preview.pdf), [[27]](https://www.shotpeener.com/library/pdf/2002061.pdf).  
4) **Heat treat + distortion control:** especially for carburized ends; LPC/HPGQ improves distortion predictability and can reduce hard machining [[44]](https://gearsolutions.com/features/advanced-distortion-control-for-case-hardening-of-transmission-components/).  
5) **Inspection burden:** weld inspection (PAUT/TOFD) [[57]](https://blog.eddyfi.com/en/automated-phased-array-inspection-of-laser-and-electron-welds-in-the-automotive-industry), [[56]](https://sonatest.com/download_file/force/df2a610a-1c73-4382-8fe0-0005dde8006e/456) vs rolling crack inspection (CT/UT) [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6678906/).  
6) **Capex/tooling vs flexibility:** rolling dies high cost [[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652625003610); swaging/radial forging tool simplicity and NC flexibility are emphasized by suppliers [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/), [[37]](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/).

### Bottom-line recommendations (most suitable manufacturing routes for NEV EDU hollow motor shafts)

**Top-tier, broadly suitable (2024–2026 industrially aligned):**
1) **Flow forming (monoblock or half-shafts) + finish machining + journal hardening/grinding; optionally laser-welded two-piece assembled shaft** for maximum lightweight + cooling integration + high-volume automation [[2]](https://netform.com/products/rotor-shafts/), [[3]](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/), [[16]](https://www.emag.com/industries-solutions/workpieces/assembled-rotor-shaft-electric-motor/), [[41]](https://www.engineering.com/manufacturing-rotor-shafts-at-the-speed-of-light-with-laser-welding/), [[42]](https://www.productionmachining.com/articles/automated-high-production-welding-of-ev-rotor-shafts).  
2) **Radial forging (semi-hot) with mandrels** for monoblock hollow/bottle-shaped rotor shafts, especially when you want internal contour freedom without welding and can accept semi-hot forming energy cost [[40]](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/).  
3) **Rotary swaging (mandrel-supported)** for high precision hollow shafts with strong near-net potential and excellent ID control/surface finish; validated on hollow motor shaft class parts and backed by quantified tolerance capability [[67]](https://strecon.com/userfiles/file/Dokumenter/STRECON%20FELSS%20Rotary%20Swaging%20Machine.pdf), [[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652625003610), [[37]](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/).

**Strong complementary/hybrid route (especially for geared/splined ends):**
4) **Tube midsection + friction-welded forged/machined ends**, followed by heat treat and grinding; attractive for combining lightweight tube with robust ends and avoiding deep drilling; weld NDT maturity is strong (TOFD/UT) [[8]](https://teamafw.com/friction-welding-projects/), [[56]](https://sonatest.com/download_file/force/df2a610a-1c73-4382-8fe0-0005dde8006e/456), [[43]](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/products/production-machines/rotary-friction-welding-machines/thompson).

**Conditionally suitable / watch-list:**
5) **CWR/skew rolling of hollow billets** where extremely high throughput is required and defect control/NDT strategy is proven; promising but with well-known central crack risks requiring robust validation [[39]](https://mrforum.com/product/9781644903254-14/), [[52]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6678906/), [[53]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924013623002510), [[1]](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/6/702).  
6) **PM-HIP / AM** mainly for niche designs (extreme internal complexity, special alloys) rather than mass EDU rotor shafts, due to cost and qualification complexity despite strong near-net potential and HIP benefits [[11]](https://www.bodycote.com/hot-isostatic-pressing/), [[13]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373729491_Additively_manufactured_air-cooled_lightweight_rotor_for_an_automotive_electric_motor), [[63]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1915241), [[12]](https://ceramics.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jace.20196).

If you share a representative EDU rotor shaft drawing (OD/ID, bearing journal sizes, rotor stack seat, spline/gear requirements, cooling features, target rpm), I can map these recommendations into a concrete “process-of-record” with suggested tolerances, inspection gates, and a short-list of the most economical route(s) for that exact geometry.
