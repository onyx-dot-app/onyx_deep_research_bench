QUESTION:
Find data and evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that an airport handling an annual passenger throughput of 500,000 (five hundred thousand) can generate significant and measurable socioeconomic impacts on its surrounding region.

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (6 total):
  #1: Research academic and policy literature (2010-2026) on socioeconomic impacts of small/regional airports around 0.2–1.0 million passengers/year, focusing on quantified impacts (jobs, GVA, tourism spend, connectivity/productivity) and whether any throughput thresholds (e.g., ~500k pax) are discussed. Summarize key methods used (I-O, CGE, econometrics) and typical multiplier ranges with citations.
  #2: Compile empirical case studies and datasets for airports with ~500,000 annual passengers (±50%) across different regions (Europe, North America, islands/peripheral) and extract measurable regional impacts (employment, business counts, tourism nights, wages, property values). Include examples of route openings/closures or expansions and note passenger numbers and outcomes with sources.
  #3: Investigate causal/quasi-experimental evidence on airport or air-service impacts on regional socioeconomic outcomes, especially for smaller airports: DiD, synthetic control, IV, event studies around route changes, airline entries/exits, PSO subsidies. Extract findings about effect sizes and detectability at smaller passenger volumes; include limitations and confounders with citations.
  #4: Find primary-source benchmarks (ACI, ATAG, FAA/ICAO, EU/UK studies) that quantify airport economic impacts per passenger (e.g., jobs per 1 million passengers, GVA per passenger) and any discussion of scaling/nonlinearities for small/regional airports. Verify the oft-quoted 'jobs per million passengers' metric with original citations and provide ranges by airport size if available.
  #5: Locate and summarize ex-post economic impact studies (not just forecasts) for specific airports with ~250k–750k annual passengers, reporting quantified local/regional impacts (direct/indirect/induced jobs, GVA/value added, visitor spend). Prioritize Europe (UK/Ireland/Scandinavia) and North America; include sources with passenger totals for the study year.
  #6: Research evidence on thresholds and heterogeneity for small-airport impacts: studies that test whether impacts become 'significant' above certain passenger levels, and conditions under which impacts are minimal/negative (leakage, diversion from other airports, subsidy dependence). Include any meta-analyses or policy evaluations (EU state aid, PSO/EAS) that discuss viability and regional benefits at ~500k passengers.

ANSWER:
## 1) What the hypothesis needs to mean to be testable

**Hypothesis:** *An airport handling ~500,000 passengers/year can generate significant and measurable socioeconomic impacts on its surrounding region.*

To evaluate that, you have to specify (otherwise different studies “prove” different things):

### A. What counts as “significant and measurable socioeconomic impacts”?
Common measurable outcomes fall into two families:

1) **“Gross economic impact” accounting (not causal):**  
Counts activity associated with the airport, typically split into:
- **Direct** on-airport jobs, payroll, and on-airport business revenue/spend  
- **Indirect** supplier-chain effects  
- **Induced** effects from employee spending  
- Often also **visitor spending** attributable to inbound passengers (tourism economy)  
These are usually estimated with **Input–Output models** (IMPLAN, etc.) and reported as **jobs (FTE), labor income, and GVA/value added**. This approach is widely used for small airports in practice [[1]](https://static.tti.tamu.edu/tti.tamu.edu/documents/0-7066-R1.pdf), with formal definitional guidance distinguishing “economic impact” from broader “transportation benefits” (time/cost savings) [[11]](https://gardnermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Airports-1992-Report-dot_35802_DS1.pdf).

2) **“Net socioeconomic impact” (causal):**  
Attempts to identify what changes *because the airport exists/expands* vs what would have happened anyway:
- Regional **GDP/GVA per capita**, **employment**, **wages**, **population growth**, **sectoral mix** (services vs manufacturing)  
- **Tourism arrivals/overnight stays**, business formation, inward investment proxies  
- **Property values** (amenity vs noise), land-use changes  
This is where quasi-experimental methods (DiD, IV, synthetic control, spatial econometrics) matter because airport activity is highly endogenous to regional growth [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X), [[23]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009411901500008X), [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf).

### B. What is the “surrounding region”?
This is critical because airport catchments overlap.
- Many studies use administrative regions (e.g., **NUTS-3 / NUTS-2** in Europe) or labor-market regions built from commuting patterns (Norway study) [[22]](https://academic.oup.com/joeg/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jeg/lbae044/60691848/lbae044.pdf), and some explicitly model spatial spillovers [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf).

### C. What does “500,000 passengers/year” mean in practice?
- “Passengers” may mean **terminal passengers** (enplaned + deplaned) or **O&D** passengers; impacts often scale with **inbound visitors** and **connectivity**, not just totals.
- At 500k/year, you might be looking at ~1,370 pax/day on average, often strongly seasonal in tourism markets.

---

## 2) Evidence **supporting** the hypothesis (measurable impacts are plausible at ~500k pax)

### 2.1 Case-based causal evidence: small/regional airport expansion can measurably raise tourism

**Memmingen Airport (Germany)** is a strong example because it uses a **synthetic control design** around a discrete “shock” (conversion from military base to commercial airport in 2007). The paper reports:
- Passenger volumes: **>450,000 in 2008**, **>800,000 in 2009** [[21]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213594/1/1686415486.pdf) (i.e., very close to the 500k scale right after opening).
- **Tourism impacts (2008–2016):** in the county where the airport is located (Lower Allgäu), the airport increased:
  - **Total arrivals at accommodations by ~54,000 per year (+22%)**
  - **Arrivals from abroad by ~23,000 per year (+69%)**  
  These are large, *measurable* effects on a concrete socioeconomic outcome (tourism demand), identified with a quasi-experimental method [[21]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213594/1/1686415486.pdf).

**What this supports:** At passenger volumes in the few-hundred-thousand range, an airport can generate **detectable tourism impacts**, especially foreign tourism and especially in the immediate county around the airport [[21]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213594/1/1686415486.pdf).

**Important nuance:** tourism increases may still include **redistribution** within a wider multi-airport system (Memmingen is also marketed as “Munich-West”), but the study’s core claim is that local tourism grew relative to a synthetic counterfactual [[21]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213594/1/1686415486.pdf).

### 2.2 “Gross impact” evidence: small airports can support hundreds to thousands of jobs and tens of millions of GVA

A detailed example of quantified airport + visitor impacts is the **Inverness Airport** impact study (Scotland). While Inverness is **~875,000 passengers (2017)**—above 500k—its quantified results show the *order of magnitude* that a sub-million-passenger airport can be associated with:

**On-airport (and on-site) impacts in the catchment:**
- **748 FTE** total on-site employment impact (direct + indirect + induced)  
- **£23.3m** income impact  
- **£33.3m** GVA impact [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf)  
It also reports a multiplier-style relationship: *for every three direct FTE jobs at the airport, ~one additional job is generated in the wider catchment* [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf).

**Inbound visitor spending and off-site impacts (2017):**
- **£89m** inbound visitor spend in the catchment (≈ **£350 per inbound passenger**) [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf)
- Off-site visitor impacts: **1,774 FTE**, **£29m** income, **£60m** GVA [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf)

**Connectivity/time-savings valuation (transport benefit, but monetized):**
- **£43m** value of passenger time savings in 2017, including **£22.5m** attributed to productivity benefits for business travel [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf)

Even if you *roughly scale* these impacts down from 875k to 500k (a simplistic proportional assumption, but useful for magnitude):
- Total employment associated with on-site + visitor impacts at Inverness is **~2,522 FTE** (748 + 1,774).  
  Per million passengers that’s about **2,883 FTE per 1m passengers** (2,522 / 0.875).  
  At **0.5m passengers**, that’s on the order of **~1,400 FTE** associated with airport + visitor channels *if similar structure holds* (tourism-heavy, inbound-leaning market). (This is a derived calculation using published figures [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf), not a claim the study makes explicitly.)

**What this supports:** A sub‑million-passenger airport can be associated with **material, reportable regional labor-market and GVA magnitudes**—certainly “measurable,” and potentially “significant” depending on regional economic size [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf).

**But:** this is an *economic impact accounting* study, not a causal estimate of what would disappear without the airport.

---

### 2.3 Benchmark “rules of thumb” imply non-trivial employment at 500k pax (with verification caveats)

A secondary source reports that ACI studies conclude airports support on average **4,700 direct+indirect+induced jobs per million passengers** [[3]](https://www.aerosociety.com/news/the-economics-of-airports/). If taken at face value, that implies:
- At **500,000 passengers/year:** ~**2,350 jobs** supported (direct+indirect+induced).  

**Caveat:** the provided source is not the underlying ACI primary report and does not give enough metadata to validate scope/method [[3]](https://www.aerosociety.com/news/the-economics-of-airports/). Treat this as an indicative benchmark rather than hard evidence.

---

### 2.4 Sectoral employment and growth evidence from broader quasi-experimental literature is consistent with “air service matters,” including for smaller places

While not centered on the 500k threshold, quasi-natural experiment evidence from the US deregulation era finds that exogenous changes in air traffic are associated with higher growth:
- Blonigen & Cristea estimate that a 50% increase in air traffic growth can raise annual **employment growth** by ~**2.7–4.7%**, with effects concentrated in **services and retail** [[23]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009411901500008X).  
- The NBER version reports preferred estimates consistent with a positive employment response to air traffic changes and notes heterogeneity where “small urban areas” can see meaningful gains relative to their baseline growth [[24]](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18278/w18278.pdf).

**What this supports:** There are plausible channels (services expansion, trade-related activity) through which air traffic changes can matter economically; small regions are not automatically excluded from benefits [[23]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009411901500008X), [[24]](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18278/w18278.pdf).  
**But:** these are city-level, historical-period estimates—not a direct statement that “500k passengers” today guarantees large local effects.

---

## 3) Evidence **refuting or strongly qualifying** the hypothesis (small-airport effects can be weak, hard to detect, or redistributive)

### 3.1 Best available Europe-wide panel evidence: small airports’ accessibility effect on GDP per capita is close to zero, and reverse causality dominates

Pot & Koster analyze 274 European NUTS‑2 regions (2000–2018) and explicitly differentiate airport sizes. Key findings:
- Estimated long-run elasticity between air accessibility and GDP per capita: **0.106 overall**
- By airport size:
  - **Large airports:** **0.179**
  - **Medium:** **0.033**
  - **Small:** **0.022** [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X)
- They also find that **for smaller airports, causality mainly runs from GDP to air accessibility**, not the other way around [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X).
- In 2018, only **3%** of the population had accessibility mainly provided by small airports (another **19%** mainly by medium+small) [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X), suggesting that in most regions small airports are not the primary driver of accessibility.

**Implication:** In an average European region, a “small airport” (often consistent with sub‑million passenger volumes) may have **limited measurable macroeconomic effect**, and observed correlations can mostly reflect that richer/faster-growing regions attract more air service rather than being transformed by it [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X). This is direct counterevidence to a strong version of the hypothesis (“500k pax necessarily creates significant regional socioeconomic uplift”).

### 3.2 System-wide airport-opening evidence (Norway): benefits exist but “small airports with little traffic and few connections” are not helpful

Rattsø & Sheard study Norway’s airport network expansion (1950–2019) using synthetic controls with staggered adoption. They find positive average effects of airport openings on population and employment growth, **especially** for:
- earlier openings (1950s),
- airports far from other airports,
- longer runways,
- links to major cities, and
- regions with complementary institutions (university/college/hospital) [[22]](https://academic.oup.com/joeg/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jeg/lbae044/60691848/lbae044.pdf).

But they explicitly warn:
- “**the effects of having a small airport are limited**”
- “**having an airport with little air traffic and few connections is not helpful for regional development**” [[22]](https://academic.oup.com/joeg/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jeg/lbae044/60691848/lbae044.pdf).

**Implication:** Passenger volume alone is not enough; connectivity quality and network integration matter. This qualifies the hypothesis substantially.

---

### 3.3 Spatial spillovers and “agglomeration shadow” mean local gains may coincide with losses elsewhere

Lenaerts, Allroggen & Malina use spatial econometric methods and IV strategies on European NUTS‑3 regions to evaluate air connectivity’s effect on service employment:
- Regions close to an airport see service-employment increases
- Regions farther away can experience negative effects (an “**agglomeration shadow**”)
- Average total impact is positive, but distributional effects matter [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf).

**Implication:** Even if a 500k‑passenger airport boosts its immediate vicinity, the net impact over a broader “surrounding region” may be smaller if activity is drawn away from nearby areas (or from competing airports) [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf).

---

### 3.4 Tourism causality is not automatic: direct air service can have negligible influence in some settings

Koo, Lim & Dobruszkes emphasize endogeneity between direct air services and tourism demand and use IV/LIML approaches. They report that for inbound flows in their context, direct air service appears to have **negligible influence** on inbound tourism demand (i.e., increasing direct service does not necessarily increase inbound tourism) [[26]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160738317301275).

**Implication:** A 500k‑passenger airport in a mature/competitive market may mainly **serve existing demand** (diverting travelers from other airports or modes) rather than creating new tourism.

---

### 3.5 “Economic impact studies” are often gross, not net—and can overstate regional development impact

Methodological guidance from FAA (Volpe) stresses:
- “Economic impact” is airport-attributable regional activity/employment/payroll (direct and indirect), but this is distinct from “transportation benefit” (time saved/cost avoided) and is **not** a full welfare analysis [[11]](https://gardnermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Airports-1992-Report-dot_35802_DS1.pdf).
- Small/medium airports often use in-house rules-of-thumb or simplified multipliers; precision and attribution can be limited [[11]](https://gardnermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Airports-1992-Report-dot_35802_DS1.pdf).

Texas A&M’s small-airport impact estimator work underscores that I‑O modeling is widely used for small airports (IMPLAN multipliers, visitor spending, FAA forecasts, etc.) to generate updated impact numbers for decision-making and grants [[1]](https://static.tti.tamu.edu/tti.tamu.edu/documents/0-7066-R1.pdf)—but this reinforces that much “evidence” in practice is designed for *impact reporting* rather than causal inference.

**Implication:** You can almost always produce “measurable impacts” at 500k passengers with I‑O accounting, but that does not prove **net new regional socioeconomic development**.

---

## 4) What the policy environment implies about the “~500k passengers” scale

EU state aid rules explicitly use passenger thresholds:
- Regional airports **<3 million passengers/year**: operating aid compatibility allowed under transitional rules (extended to 2027) [[2]](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/state-aid-guidelines-on-aid-to-airports-and-airlines.html).
- A specific regime with **higher aid intensity** for airports **up to 700,000 passengers/year** (extended to 2027) due to profitability challenges, COVID-19 impacts, and war-related disruptions [[2]](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/state-aid-guidelines-on-aid-to-airports-and-airlines.html).

**What this tells you (indirect evidence):**
- Policymakers treat airports in the **sub‑700k band** as **structurally vulnerable** and potentially requiring public support to maintain connectivity [[2]](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/state-aid-guidelines-on-aid-to-airports-and-airlines.html).
- The justification is connectivity and avoiding closure rather than a quantified claim that these airports always generate large net economic growth [[2]](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/state-aid-guidelines-on-aid-to-airports-and-airlines.html).

So policy thresholds support a *connectivity importance* narrative for airports near 500k passengers, while simultaneously implying that **market profitability is not assured** at that scale.

---

## 5) Mechanisms: when a ~500k passenger airport is most/least likely to generate “significant” regional impacts

### A. Mechanisms that can create measurable effects at ~500k
1) **Inbound visitor economy (tourism)**
- Strong when a high share of passengers are inbound leisure and stay overnight.  
- Memmingen shows large measured impacts on accommodation arrivals and foreign arrivals after airport opening [[21]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213594/1/1686415486.pdf).  
- Inverness quantifies inbound visitor spend (£89m) and associated GVA/jobs in its catchment [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf).

2) **Business connectivity and productivity/time savings**
- Inverness monetizes passenger time savings (£43m), with a productivity component for business travel (£22.5m) [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf).  
This channel can be important even if tourism is modest, but measuring it causally is hard.

3) **Direct + supply-chain employment**
- Airports are “centers of employment,” including tenants and surrounding businesses that rely on airport access [[1]](https://static.tti.tamu.edu/tti.tamu.edu/documents/0-7066-R1.pdf).  
This can be measured as jobs/income/GVA, though “net” vs “gross” remains the key issue [[11]](https://gardnermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Airports-1992-Report-dot_35802_DS1.pdf).

4) **Regional resilience / essential access (health, education, government)**
- Often emphasized for remote regions; Inverness stakeholders report broader social/catalytic roles like staff attraction/retention and community viability [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf).  
This is real but harder to quantify rigorously.

### B. Conditions under which impacts may be small or not “significant”
1) **Overlapping catchments / multi-airport competition**
- A 500k airport near a major hub may mainly divert passengers; net regional impact can be small.

2) **Low connectivity quality**
- Norway evidence warns that “little traffic and few connections” offers limited development benefit [[22]](https://academic.oup.com/joeg/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jeg/lbae044/60691848/lbae044.pdf).

3) **Endogeneity dominates**
- Europe-wide evidence suggests small-airport accessibility is often more an *outcome* of GDP than a *cause* [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X).

4) **Distributional effects**
- Spatial econometrics finds potential “agglomeration shadow”—benefits close to airports, losses further away [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf).

---

## 6) So—can 500,000 passengers/year generate “significant and measurable” impacts? A balanced verdict

### What the evidence supports
- **Yes, measurable impacts are absolutely possible at around 500k passengers/year**, particularly via **tourism** and localized service-economy channels.
  - Causal/quasi-experimental evidence: Memmingen’s opening produced **large, measurable tourism-arrivals gains** at passenger volumes in the hundreds of thousands [[21]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213594/1/1686415486.pdf).
  - Impact-accounting evidence: Inverness (sub‑1M passengers) is associated with **hundreds of on-site FTE**, **~£33m on-site GVA**, plus **large inbound visitor spending and visitor-supported employment/GVA**, and sizeable time-savings valuation [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf).

If “significant” is interpreted relative to a small regional economy (rural/peripheral), then impacts of the magnitude reported in [[7]](https://www.hie.co.uk/media/3003/economicplusandplussocialplusimpactplusofplusinvernessplusairportplus-plusexecutiveplussummary.pdf)—even scaled down—could indeed be economically meaningful.

### What the evidence refutes (or forces you to narrow)
- **No, 500k passengers/year does not reliably or universally produce significant net regional development.**  
  The strongest multi-region evidence finds **small airports’ GDP-per-capita elasticity is tiny (0.022)** and that **reverse causality is especially strong for smaller airports** [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X). Norway’s system evidence explicitly warns that **small airports with low traffic and few connections are not helpful** [[22]](https://academic.oup.com/joeg/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jeg/lbae044/60691848/lbae044.pdf).
- Even where local gains occur, spatial evidence suggests **some benefits may be offset by losses elsewhere** (“agglomeration shadow”) [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf).

### Bottom line
A defensible, evidence-consistent statement is:

> **An airport at ~500,000 passengers/year can generate significant and measurable socioeconomic impacts in certain contexts (notably tourism-oriented or peripheral regions with meaningful new connectivity), but the average causal macroeconomic effect of small airports is often modest and hard to identify; results are highly heterogeneous and can be partly redistributive rather than net new.**

## 7) How you would *prove or disprove* significant impact for a specific 500k-passenger airport today (data + designs)

### A. Minimum measurement set (annual, over 10–20 years ideally)
1) **Air service / traffic**
- Route-level passengers, frequencies, seats, carriers (e.g., US BTS T‑100 segment/market data) [[12]](https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/bts-publications/%E2%80%A2-data-bank-28is-t-100-and-t-100f), [[13]](https://geodata.bts.gov/datasets/usdot::t-100-domestic-market-and-segment-data/about), [[14]](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/t-100-domestic-market-and-segment-data1).  
- For Europe, Eurostat provides airport passenger data for airports above thresholds (monthly transmission for airports >150k passenger units/year) [[15]](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/transport/information-data/air-transport), with airport-by-airport annual series since 2003 referenced in metadata [[16]](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/avia_pa_esms.htm).

2) **Tourism outcomes**
- Accommodation **arrivals, nights**, foreign share, spend proxies (tax receipts, card data if available)

3) **Economy**
- Employment by sector, wages, firm counts, productivity proxies; population

4) **Spatial controls**
- Travel time to nearest alternative airports; road/rail investments; region fixed effects; neighbor-region outcomes (to test spillovers)

### B. Identification strategies that match the literature’s challenges
1) **Synthetic control around discrete events** (best when the “shock” is clear)
- Airport opening, runway extension, entry/exit of a dominant low-cost carrier  
(Aligned with Memmingen methodology) [[21]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213594/1/1686415486.pdf).

2) **Difference-in-differences with event studies**
- Around route inaugurations/terminations or base openings  
Must test pre-trends and handle spillovers/overlapping catchments (a common failure mode noted in spatial work) [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf).

3) **Instrumental variables for connectivity**
- Needed because air traffic is endogenous (Pot & Koster emphasize GDP → accessibility for small airports) [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X).  
Network-based instruments are used in spatial connectivity work [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf); historical-plan instruments are discussed in the airports/employment literature (as summarized in available excerpt) [[27]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119014000060).

4) **Explicit spatial modeling**
- To detect “agglomeration shadow” and avoid overstating net impacts [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf).

### C. Reporting both “gross” and “net”
A robust evaluation typically reports:
- **Gross impact accounting** (I‑O jobs/GVA; visitor spend) as stakeholders often demand [[1]](https://static.tti.tamu.edu/tti.tamu.edu/documents/0-7066-R1.pdf), while clearly labeling it as non-causal per FAA guidance [[11]](https://gardnermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Airports-1992-Report-dot_35802_DS1.pdf).
- **Net causal estimates** (employment, tourism nights, wages, GDP per capita) using quasi-experimental methods [[21]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213594/1/1686415486.pdf), [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X), [[25]](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/37359/2/Air%20connectivity%20and%20regional%20employment%20%20a%20spatial%20econometrics%20approach.pdf).

## 8) Practical interpretation of the 500k threshold

There is **no universal passenger-throughput threshold** at which impacts suddenly become “significant.” What does exist is:

- A **policy-relevant size band**: EU rules treat **≤700k passengers/year** airports as especially challenged and eligible for higher aid intensity [[2]](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/state-aid-guidelines-on-aid-to-airports-and-airlines.html). That suggests airports around 500k are often “small” in market power and financial resilience, not necessarily small in local importance.
- Empirical evidence that **size/connectivity matters nonlinearly**: large airports show much stronger accessibility–GDP relationships than small airports [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X).

So the more accurate question than “is 500k enough?” is:

> **Does 500k passengers come with (i) meaningful new connectivity, (ii) a high inbound-visitor share, and/or (iii) substantial time savings versus alternatives, in a region not already well-served by nearby hubs?**

When the answer is yes, the literature includes credible examples of **measurable socioeconomic impacts** even at (or near) 500k passengers [[21]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213594/1/1686415486.pdf). When the answer is no, the best broad evidence suggests effects may be **small, hard to detect, or mainly reflective of reverse causality** [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232100315X), [[22]](https://academic.oup.com/joeg/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jeg/lbae044/60691848/lbae044.pdf), [[26]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160738317301275).
