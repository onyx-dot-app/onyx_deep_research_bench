QUESTION:
Is there a general method for solving a first-price sealed-bid auction with two bidders who have independent private values drawn from different distributions (i.e., ex-ante asymmetric bidders)?

============================================================

RESEARCH TASKS (4 total):
  #1: Research the general equilibrium characterization and solution method for a two-bidder first-price sealed-bid auction with independent private values and asymmetric distributions. Derive the coupled differential equations for bidding functions (or inverse bid functions), including boundary conditions, and summarize the standard derivation steps and any canonical references.
  #2: Investigate known existence/uniqueness results and regularity conditions for asymmetric first-price auctions with two independent private-value bidders. Focus on conditions guaranteeing a unique strictly increasing pure-strategy BNE and document pathologies (multiple equilibria, non-monotone strategies, atoms), with key citations.
  #3: Find practical approaches and 'general methods' used when closed forms are unavailable for asymmetric two-bidder first-price auctions: numerical boundary-value problem solvers, fixed-point iteration, simulation/verification diagnostics, and any transformation techniques (hazard rate/virtual value, inverse bidding). Include references and implementation guidance.
  #4: Research ‘general methods’ (analytic/implicit) to solve asymmetric two-bidder first-price IPV auctions beyond numerical methods: inverse-bid ODE system, integral equation representations, winning-probability/envelope approaches (Myerson), hazard-rate transformations, and identify when closed forms exist (e.g., piecewise linear/step equilibria with nonoverlapping supports, uniform families). Provide standard references and a clear description of the method pipeline from primitives (F1,F2) to equilibrium bids.

============================================================

ANSWER:
Yes. For **two asymmetric bidders with independent private values**, there is a fairly standard *general method*—but it usually delivers an **implicit characterization** (a coupled ODE / boundary-value problem), not a closed form except in special cases.

Below is the canonical pipeline used in the theory and the applied/numerical literature, plus what is known about existence/uniqueness and what you do in practice when closed forms fail.

## 1) Baseline model and what “solving” means

- Two bidders \(i\in\{1,2\}\).
- Values \(v_i\) are independently drawn from **different** distributions \(F_i\) (densities \(f_i\)) on an interval support (often normalized to \([0,\bar v]\), or bidder-specific \([c_i,d_i]\)). Independence + private values. Risk-neutral utilities.  
- Each bidder submits a sealed bid \(b\). Highest bid wins and pays his own bid (first price). (Tie-breaking details can matter technically; see §5.3.)  
- A (pure-strategy) BNE is typically sought in **strictly increasing** bid functions \(b_i(v)\), so they are invertible. Existence/regularity of monotone equilibria under standard conditions is established in the classic asymmetric-auction literature (Lebrun; Maskin–Riley) and commonly taken as a starting point for characterization [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf), [[2]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/NumericalSolutions.pdf), [[3]](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ier/iecrev/v40y1999i1p125-42.html).

So “solving the auction” typically means finding the equilibrium bid functions \(b_1(\cdot), b_2(\cdot)\) (or their inverses), plus the equilibrium bid support and the *common* upper-end bid.

---

## 2) The core general method: convert equilibrium to an ODE system in inverse bids (a boundary-value problem)

### 2.1 Why inverse bid functions are used
In asymmetric first-price auctions, the most convenient unknowns are often the **inverse bidding strategies**:
\[
\nu_i(b) \equiv b_i^{-1}(b).
\]
This transforms best-response conditions into a **system of ODEs** in \(\nu_1,\nu_2\) with boundary conditions. This is the approach emphasized by Lebrun’s “inverse strategies solve a system of differential equations with boundary conditions” characterization [[3]](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ier/iecrev/v40y1999i1p125-42.html), and it is the starting point for essentially all numerical methods in the applied literature [[4]](https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/laeccr/9715.html), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

### 2.2 Derivation sketch (two bidders)
Assume strictly increasing strategies, so bidder \(j\)’s bid \(b\) corresponds to type \(\nu_j(b)\). If bidder \(i\) of value \(v\) bids \(b\), he wins iff opponent’s value \(v_j \le \nu_j(b)\), so win probability is \(F_j(\nu_j(b))\). Expected payoff:
\[
\pi_i(b; v)= (v-b)\,F_j(\nu_j(b)).
\]
In equilibrium, type \(v=\nu_i(b)\) chooses \(b\) optimally, so FOC at \(b=b_i(v)\):
\[
0=\frac{d}{db}\left[(\nu_i(b)-b)F_j(\nu_j(b))\right]
= -F_j(\nu_j(b)) + (\nu_i(b)-b) f_j(\nu_j(b))\,\nu_j'(b).
\]
Rearrange to get a coupled ODE:
\[
\nu_j'(b)=\frac{F_j(\nu_j(b))}{f_j(\nu_j(b))}\cdot \frac{1}{\nu_i(b)-b}.
\]
Applying the same reasoning with \(i\) and \(j\) swapped yields the 2-equation system:
\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\nu_1'(b)&=\frac{F_1(\nu_1(b))}{f_1(\nu_1(b))}\cdot \frac{1}{\nu_2(b)-b},\\[4pt]
\nu_2'(b)&=\frac{F_2(\nu_2(b))}{f_2(\nu_2(b))}\cdot \frac{1}{\nu_1(b)-b}.
\end{aligned}}
\]
This is exactly the \(n\)-bidder inverse-strategy ODE specialized to \(n=2\) (the general \(n\) form is stated explicitly in the numerical literature and attributed to Maskin–Riley/Lebrun foundations) [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

**Key structural features**
- The term \(\frac{F_i}{f_i}\) appears: an **inverse hazard-type object** that makes endpoint behavior important for stability/uniqueness [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).
- Singularities arise as \(\nu_i(b)\to b\) (i.e., bids approach values), which is a major source of numerical difficulty [[6]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/numericalanalysis.pdf).

### 2.3 Boundary conditions (the crucial “extra” information)
The ODEs alone do not pin down a unique solution; equilibrium adds boundary conditions:

1) **Lower boundary (often normalized to 0):**
   \[
   b_i(0)=0\quad \Rightarrow\quad \nu_i(0)=0.
   \]
   This is stated as a property in Lebrun-style analyses and used as a baseline in expositions and computations [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

2) **Common upper bid / common bid support endpoint:**
   There exists a **common maximal equilibrium bid** \(\bar b\) such that the top type of *each* bidder submits \(\bar b\). In inverse form (with values normalized to 1 or \(\bar v\)):
   \[
   \boxed{\exists\,\bar b\ \text{s.t.}\ \nu_1(\bar b)=\nu_2(\bar b)=\bar v.}
   \]
   The “highest bid is the same for all buyers” property is attributed to Lebrun and is central both theoretically and computationally [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf). In numerical work it is treated as the additional boundary restriction that selects the equilibrium solution among many local ODE solutions [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

So the equilibrium is a **two-point boundary value problem (BVP)**: conditions at \(b=0\) and at \(b=\bar b\), but \(\bar b\) itself is unknown and must be found jointly [[4]](https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/laeccr/9715.html), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

---

## 3) An alternative but equivalent “general method”: solve for winning probabilities, then recover bids (envelope approach)

A different general strategy—more *mechanism-design flavored*—is to characterize equilibrium via **winning probabilities** \(q_i(v)\) rather than bids.

Let \(q_i(v)\) be bidder \(i\)’s equilibrium probability of winning given value \(v\). In a monotone equilibrium, the deviation problem “pretend to be type \(z\)” implies the standard envelope logic:
\[
EU_i(v)=\max_z (v-b_i(z))q_i(z)\quad\Rightarrow\quad EU_i'(v)=q_i(v).
\]
With \(EU_i(0)=0\), this gives
\[
EU_i(v)=\int_0^v q_i(x)\,dx.
\]
Since also \(EU_i(v)=(v-b_i(v))q_i(v)\), you can recover bids from \(q_i\):
\[
\boxed{
b_i(v)= v-\int_0^v \frac{q_i(x)}{q_i(v)}\,dx.
}
\]
This approach is laid out explicitly in asymmetric IPV expositions and is conceptually tied to Myerson’s incentive-compatibility/envelope framework [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf), [[7]](http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~fibich/Manuscripts/first_rev_final.pdf).

**What it buys you**
- Sometimes \(q_i\) is easier to reason about qualitatively (crossing, dominance, etc.) than \(b_i\) [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf).
- It gives an explicit “reconstruction formula” once you have \(q_i\).

**What it doesn’t remove**
- You still need an equilibrium characterization of \(q_i\), which generally reduces back to the same ODE/BVP logic (just in different variables). So it is more an *analytic lens* than a closed-form solution technique in the asymmetric case.

---

## 4) When does the method yield closed forms?

Generally: **rarely**. The ODE system is usually not integrable in closed form for arbitrary \(F_1,F_2\).

But there are important special families:

### 4.1 Uniform distributions (general asymmetric supports)
For two bidders with values **uniform on (possibly different) intervals**, analytic solutions exist in broad generality; Kaplan–Zamir (building on the classic “Vickrey 1961 problem”) provide analytic solutions for the two-bidder uniform case and even allow binding minimum bids; they also identify subclasses with **linear** equilibrium bid functions [[8]](http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~fibich/Manuscripts/BV_Method_GEB11.pdf). (This is one of the most complete “closed-form asymmetric” families known.)

### 4.2 Non-overlapping supports / extreme asymmetry → “flat” bidding by the strong bidder
Maskin–Riley provide explicit examples where one bidder’s value support lies strictly above the other’s. Then the strong bidder may optimally bid a **constant** just high enough to beat any weak type (a preemptive bid), while the weak bidder bids his value [[9]](http://www.econ.ucla.edu/riley/research/asyRES.PDF). This produces a piecewise/step-like equilibrium that is trivial to compute—because the allocation is essentially determined by support separation.

### 4.3 Particular parametric “stretched/scaled” families
Maskin–Riley also give explicit inverse-bid formulas in certain parametric uniform “stretched” families [[9]](http://www.econ.ucla.edu/riley/research/asyRES.PDF). These are useful as templates and benchmarks.

### 4.4 Symmetric case (as a sanity check)
When \(F_1=F_2\), the system collapses to a single ODE with a known closed-form solution:
\[
b(v)=v-\frac{\int_0^v F(x)^{n-1}dx}{F(v)^{n-1}}.
\]
This is not the asymmetric case, but it is central for verifying numerical implementations and for understanding why endpoint behavior matters (the term \(1/F^{n-1}\) blows up near the lower end) [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

---

## 5) Existence, uniqueness, and main “pathologies” in the asymmetric two-bidder case

### 5.1 Existence and monotone (invertible) equilibria
Lebrun’s work establishes existence and the “equilibria are essentially pure and characterized by inverse bid ODEs with boundary conditions” message [[3]](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ier/iecrev/v40y1999i1p125-42.html). Many expositions proceed under regularity assumptions (independence; continuous atomless distributions; positive density on the interior) under which equilibrium strategies are continuous, strictly increasing, and differentiable on the interior—so the ODE method is applicable [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf).

### 5.2 Uniqueness: what conditions give a single monotone equilibrium?
Uniqueness is delicate. The literature gives several sufficient routes:

- **Positive mass at the lower endpoint** (an atom) is a strong uniqueness condition in classic treatments. Lebrun (1999) states uniqueness when valuation distributions have a mass point at the lower extremity [[3]](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ier/iecrev/v40y1999i1p125-42.html). Maskin–Riley’s uniqueness results for sealed high-bid auctions also assume **positive mass at the lower endpoint** and apply uniqueness arguments via ODE uniqueness (FTODE) logic, and they note that asymmetry does not break uniqueness when there are only **two** bidders under their maintained assumptions [[10]](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/jackson+swinkels-econometrica-2005A.pdf), [[11]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825605000540).

- **Local strict log-concavity of \(F_i\) near the lower endpoint** (equivalently decreasing *reverse hazard rate* \(f_i/F_i\) locally) is another sufficient condition for uniqueness without atoms. Lebrun (2006; working-paper statement) provides a uniqueness theorem based on strict log-concavity “at the highest lower extremity” of supports [[12]](https://econ.laps.yorku.ca/files/2015/10/lebrunb-u.pdf), [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825603001507).

These results matter because in the asymmetric case the ODE system is a BVP with an unknown endpoint; uniqueness means the endpoint and the solution path are pinned down.

### 5.3 Pathologies and complications you should expect
Even with two bidders, several nontrivial issues arise:

1) **ODE degeneracy at the lower endpoint (“0/0” problem).**  
   In inverse-bid ODEs, the RHS can be indeterminate at the lower boundary (e.g., \(\nu_i(0)=0\) leads to expressions of the form \(0/0\)), so naive initial-value ODE theory and naive forward integration do not work cleanly. This is emphasized in numerical analyses and is one reason equilibrium is treated as a BVP rather than an IVP [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

2) **Shooting instability near the origin.**  
   The classic algorithm is to guess \(\bar b\) and integrate backward (“backward shooting”), but the system is numerically ill-behaved near the lower endpoint. Marshall et al. stress “major pathologies at the origin”: forward integration tends to go to nuisance attractors that miss terminal conditions, while backward integration becomes highly unstable near 0 [[4]](https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/laeccr/9715.html). Fibich–Gavish argue this instability is inherent and worsens with more bidders [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

3) **Tie-breaking and discontinuities.**  
   Auctions are discontinuous at ties; in some models, equilibrium existence can hinge on how ties are broken. Lebrun explicitly notes ties may need non-fair tie-breaking rules for equilibrium existence in some cases (citing several works) [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825603001507). Jackson–Swinkels address these discontinuity issues by proving existence of equilibria (in broad classes) and tie-breaking invariance under their equilibrium framework, but that may yield equilibria beyond strictly monotone pure strategies [[14]](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/kirkegaard-journal-of-economic-theory-2009A.pdf).

4) **Crossing of bid functions / “weakness implies aggression” need not be globally true.**  
   If \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) are not ordered by FOSD, equilibrium bid functions can cross, and can even cross multiple times. Kirkegaard shows FOSD is necessary to avoid crossings and discusses examples and bounds on crossing behavior; multi-crossing is also documented in numerical work [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf). This doesn’t prevent existence of monotone-in-own-type strategies, but it breaks simple comparative statics.

---

## 6) Practical “general methods” when no closed form exists (how people actually solve it)

Because the theoretical method gives a BVP, practice is about **solving the BVP reliably**.

### 6.1 Backward shooting on the unknown common upper bid \(\bar b\)
This is the traditional workhorse:

1) Guess \(\bar b\).
2) Impose \(\nu_1(\bar b)=\nu_2(\bar b)=\bar v\) and integrate the ODE system backward in \(b\) toward 0.
3) Check whether \(\nu_i(0)=0\) holds; update \(\bar b\) and repeat.

Marshall et al. describe the BVP nature and the endpoint-search difficulty; they also document why naive forward/backward shooting can be unstable and why high accuracy is essential [[4]](https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/laeccr/9715.html). Hubbard–Kirkegaard–Paarsch provide a clear implementation description of reverse shooting, including “blow-up vs miss” diagnostics and bracketing/bisection/Newton updates for \(\bar b\) [[6]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/numericalanalysis.pdf).

**Pros:** simple conceptually; uses standard ODE solvers.  
**Cons:** can be severely unstable near the lower endpoint in asymmetric problems [[4]](https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/laeccr/9715.html), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

### 6.2 Treat it directly as a boundary-value problem (fixed-domain transformations)
Fibich–Gavish propose a “boundary-value method” rather than shooting, including a change of independent variable to map the unknown-endpoint problem onto a fixed domain, then solve with Newton or fixed-point iterations [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

**Pros:** reported to be much more robust than shooting in simulations, including for difficult asymmetric crossings [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).  
**Cons:** the convergence guarantees are largely empirical in that work (they explicitly caution they do not prove general convergence of the iterations) [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

### 6.3 High-accuracy local series / Taylor expansion methods
Gayle–Richard propose a robust algorithm based on a “built-in algebra of local Taylor-series expansions” to compute accurate solutions to the defining ODEs, with automation for common parametric families and even tabulated distributions [[2]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/NumericalSolutions.pdf). They still rely on backward extrapolation and iteration over the unknown endpoint, but their local expansions are designed to stabilize computation near problematic regions [[2]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/NumericalSolutions.pdf).

### 6.4 Global approximation of inverse bids (polynomials, MPEC)
A different approach is to approximate \(\nu_i(b)\) (or \(b_i(v)\)) by flexible parametric forms (e.g., polynomials) and choose coefficients to satisfy equilibrium conditions approximately.

Hubbard–Kirkegaard–Paarsch describe polynomial approximation approaches (building on Bajari-style ideas) and emphasize that these methods avoid shooting instability and can be fast enough for repeated equilibrium computations (estimation, counterfactuals), but accuracy must be checked carefully; low-degree approximations can mislead [[15]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566961). They also discuss using MPEC-like formulations (Su–Judd style) to incorporate equilibrium constraints and obtain good starting values [[15]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566961).

### 6.5 Verification diagnostics (essential in asymmetric numerics)
Since convergence proofs are scarce and multiple numerical methods can fail silently, researchers emphasize diagnostics such as:

- Check monotonicity/invertibility and that bids stay below values (\(\nu_i(b)>b\) / \(b_i(v)<v\)), otherwise the ODE terms blow up [[6]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/numericalanalysis.pdf).
- Compute pointwise best responses to ensure no profitable deviations (feasible when you can evaluate payoffs given computed strategies) [[2]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/NumericalSolutions.pdf).
- Check qualitative theoretical properties (e.g., expected utility of top types consistent with common upper bid; crossing behavior when distributions cross) [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf), [[15]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566961).

---

## 7) A compact “template” you can reuse (two bidders)

Given \(F_1,f_1,F_2,f_2\) on \([0,\bar v]\) (or after normalizing supports), the standard method is:

1) **Assume** a strictly increasing equilibrium exists (or verify conditions from Lebrun/Maskin–Riley-type results; see §5.2).  
2) Work with inverse bids \(\nu_i(b)\).  
3) Solve the coupled ODE system on \(b\in(0,\bar b)\):
   \[
   \nu_1'(b)=\frac{F_1(\nu_1(b))}{f_1(\nu_1(b))}\cdot \frac{1}{\nu_2(b)-b},\quad
   \nu_2'(b)=\frac{F_2(\nu_2(b))}{f_2(\nu_2(b))}\cdot \frac{1}{\nu_1(b)-b}.
   \]
4) Impose boundary conditions:
   - \(\nu_1(0)=\nu_2(0)=0\) (or at the common lower support point),
   - \(\nu_1(\bar b)=\nu_2(\bar b)=\bar v\) for some unknown \(\bar b\) (common maximal bid) [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).
5) Use a numerical BVP method (shooting, transformed BVP + Newton, Taylor/local expansions, or polynomial/MPEC approximation) to find \(\nu_1,\nu_2,\bar b\) [[2]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/NumericalSolutions.pdf), [[4]](https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/laeccr/9715.html), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf), [[6]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/numericalanalysis.pdf), [[15]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566961).  
6) Recover direct strategies by inversion: \(b_i(v)=\nu_i^{-1}(v)\) (interpolation).  
7) Validate equilibrium numerically (best-response checks, monotonicity, boundary conditions, payoff consistency).

That is the general method in a nutshell.

---

## 8) Bottom line

- **General method exists:** characterize equilibrium via **inverse bid functions solving a coupled ODE system with boundary conditions**, including the key “common maximal bid” condition [[3]](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ier/iecrev/v40y1999i1p125-42.html), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf), [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf).  
- **Closed forms are exceptional:** mostly limited to special distribution families (notably uniforms on intervals) or extreme-support cases [[8]](http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~fibich/Manuscripts/BV_Method_GEB11.pdf), [[9]](http://www.econ.ucla.edu/riley/research/asyRES.PDF).  
- **In practice:** solving means implementing a **boundary value solver** (often with endpoint search) and validating carefully; backward shooting is traditional but unstable near the lower endpoint; more robust BVP or approximation methods are widely used [[4]](https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/laeccr/9715.html), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf), [[2]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/NumericalSolutions.pdf), [[15]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566961), [[6]](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/numericalanalysis.pdf).  
- **Uniqueness/regularity:** requires additional conditions (atoms at the lower endpoint; log-concavity near the lower endpoint; etc.), and there are known complications (tie-breaking issues, crossings, numerical instability) [[10]](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/jackson+swinkels-econometrica-2005A.pdf), [[3]](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ier/iecrev/v40y1999i1p125-42.html), [[12]](https://econ.laps.yorku.ca/files/2015/10/lebrunb-u.pdf), [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825603001507), [[14]](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/kirkegaard-journal-of-economic-theory-2009A.pdf), [[1]](https://brocku.ca/repec/pdf/0504.pdf), [[4]](https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/laeccr/9715.html), [[5]](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/papers/econpaper31.pdf).

If you share concrete \(F_1,F_2\) (supports and functional forms), I can write the exact normalized ODE/BVP for that case and outline a stable computational procedure (including how to bracket \(\bar b\) and which solver choices tend to work best).
