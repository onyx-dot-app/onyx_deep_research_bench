ANSWER:
## 1) Global AI investment levels & major commitments (2023–2026) — what’s been publicly quantified

### A. Big-ticket “we are investing $X/€X” commitments (and what they cover)

- **Accenture — $3B (over 3 years, announced 2023)** to expand its Data & AI practice across “assets, industry solutions, ventures, acquisitions, talent and ecosystem partnerships,” plus launch items such as **AI Navigator for Enterprise** and a **Center for Advanced AI**; also stated intent to **double AI talent to 80,000** via hiring/acquisitions/training [[1]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2023/accenture-to-invest-3-billion-in-ai-to-accelerate-clients-reinvention).  
  - Follow-through indicators: FY2025 reporting shows **~77,000 AI & Data professionals** and **550,000+ people trained in GenAI fundamentals** [[57]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-4/accenture-360-value-report-2025-custom.pdf); Accenture also reported **$2.7B FY2025 revenue from “advanced AI” (genAI + agentic + physical AI)** and **$5.9B bookings** in that category [[61]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-4/Annual-Report-2025.pdf).

- **Capgemini — €2B (over 3 years, announced 2023)** to build leadership in AI (including genAI), develop industry offers, expand partnerships (notably Microsoft and Google Cloud), **train most of its workforce via its Data & AI Campus**, and **double Data & AI teams to 60,000** in 3 years [[29]](https://www.capgemini.com/in-en/news/press-releases/capgemini-reports-strong-half-year-performance-robust-growth-and-improved-operating-margin/). Reuters corroborated the €2B plan and the 60,000 target [[30]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/capgemini-posts-69-rise-half-year-revenue-2023-07-28/).  
  - Talent progress signals: Capgemini reported training **120,000+ employees** on genAI tools by H1 2024 [[113]](https://investors.capgemini.com/en/publication/2024-h1-results/) and later reporting “**150,000+ trained**” [[114]](https://reports.capgemini.com/2024/en/assets/files/Capgemini-2024-Integrated-Annual-Report.pdf).

- **Deloitte — $2B (IndustryAdvantage™, announced 2024)**: a strategic investment explicitly tied to industry-focused solutions using **AI, engineering, and cybersecurity**, including an industry tech incubator, **100+ genAI accelerators**, and workforce development [[2]](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deloitte-invests-2-billion-to-accelerate-industryadvantage-for-its-clients-302108115.html).  
  - In parallel, Deloitte later stated a longer-horizon commitment: **“over $3B of investments in GenAI through FY2030”** to transform delivery/operations and launch products/offerings [[99]](https://www.deloitte.com/mt/en/about/press-room/global-revenue-announcement.html). (This is a different framing/timeline than the $2B IndustryAdvantage™ announcement.)

- **PwC — $1B (PwC US, over 3 years, announced 2023)** to expand and scale AI offerings, strongly tied to Microsoft and Azure OpenAI/ChatGPT capability, and to upskill **65,000** PwC US people via “My+” [[5]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-us-makes-billion-investment-in-ai-capabilities.html).  
  - PwC network-wide statements later describe **nearly $1.5B** being invested across the network to expand/scale AI capabilities [[6]](https://www.pwc.com/mu/en/about-us/global-annual-review/artificial-intelligence.html), reiterated in FY2025 reporting [[7]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2025/pwc-global-revenues-rise.html).  
  - Separately, PwC also described **$1B+** investment in its **Next Generation Audit** platform (pilots 2025; rollout starting 2026) [[6]](https://www.pwc.com/mu/en/about-us/global-annual-review/artificial-intelligence.html), reiterated as “$1B” in FY2025 reporting [[7]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2025/pwc-global-revenues-rise.html).  
  - Important caution: these PwC figures appear to refer to **different scopes** (PwC US vs global network; AI capability scaling vs audit platform) and should **not be summed** without reconciliation [[5]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-us-makes-billion-investment-in-ai-capabilities.html)[[6]](https://www.pwc.com/mu/en/about-us/global-annual-review/artificial-intelligence.html)[[7]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2025/pwc-global-revenues-rise.html).

- **EY — $1.4B “foundation” for EY.ai (announced 2023)**: EY said **$1.4B of investments** (including tech acquisitions, cloud/automation, and embedding AI into proprietary tech like **EY Fabric**) provided the foundation for **EY.ai** [[10]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2023/09/ey-announces-launch-of-artificial-intelligence-platform-ey-ai-following-us-1-4b-investment).  
  - Separately, EY described a **$1B, four-year Assurance technology investment** (program announced 2022; updates 2025) integrating leading-edge AI into its global Assurance platform supporting **160,000+ audit engagements** and **140,000 assurance professionals** [[11]](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/newsroom/2025/04/ey-announces-large-scale-integration-of-leading-edge-ai-technology-into-global-assurance-technology-platform).  
  - As with PwC, these are **distinctly framed** programs; the sources do not provide a single consolidated EY “total AI investment” number [[10]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2023/09/ey-announces-launch-of-artificial-intelligence-platform-ey-ai-following-us-1-4b-investment)[[11]](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/newsroom/2025/04/ey-announces-large-scale-integration-of-leading-edge-ai-technology-into-global-assurance-technology-platform).

- **KPMG — $2B (5 years) AI + cloud commitment via Microsoft partnership (reported by Reuters, 2023)** [[14]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/kpmg-plans-2-bln-investment-ai-cloud-services-wsj-2023-07-11/). Microsoft’s own release described a “multibillion” commitment but without a precise figure [[13]](https://news.microsoft.com/source/2023/07/11/kpmg-and-microsoft-enter-landmark-agreement-to-put-ai-at-the-forefront-of-professional-services/).  
  - **Additional $100M (over 4 years) with Google Cloud (Reuters, 2024)** to bolster enterprise AI services, including AI agents and training [[16]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/kpmg-spend-100-million-ai-partnership-with-google-cloud-2024-11-20/).

- **IBM — $500M AI venture fund (announced 2023)**: **IBM Enterprise AI Venture Fund** to invest in enterprise AI startups [[26]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-11-07-IBM-Launches-500-Million-Enterprise-AI-Venture-Fund).  
  - IBM Consulting investment is more often expressed as **capability build + acquisitions** (e.g., **Hakkoda** acquisition to expand data/AI consultancy, terms undisclosed) [[28]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-04-07-ibm-acquires-hakkoda-inc-,-expanding-data-expertise-to-fuel-clients-ai-transformations) and platform/service launches rather than a single consulting-unit dollar pledge.

- **McKinsey / BCG / Bain (MBB)**: in the captured sources, **no single firmwide, dollar-denominated AI investment pledge** is provided for McKinsey/BCG/Bain comparable to the Big Four/Accenture/Capgemini announcements. Instead, commitments are evidenced via **acquisitions, partnerships, headcount scale, and internal platforms**:
  - McKinsey acquired **Iguazio** (MLOps / AI & ML operations), price undisclosed [[17]](https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-acquires-iguazio-a-leader-in-ai-and-machine-learning-technology).  
  - BCG disclosed **AI-related advisory ~20% of total revenue in 2024** and **BCG X 3,000+ experts** [[21]](https://www.bcg.com/press/bcg-announces-re-election-of-chief-executive-officer-christoph-schweizer).  
  - Bain emphasized alliances (notably OpenAI) and internal deployment but did not publish a single AI investment total in the provided sources [[23]](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2024/bain-and-company-announces-expanded-partnership-with-openai-to-accelerate-delivery-of-ai-solutions-and-meet-fast-growing-client-needs/).

### B. Partnerships as “investment multipliers” (hyperscalers/model providers/enterprise SaaS)

Across the firms, large alliances are central to scaling AI delivery:

- **Accenture × NVIDIA**: expanded partnership (2024) to scale “agentic AI,” launch AI Refinery and a dedicated Accenture NVIDIA Business Group; Accenture stated **30,000+ professionals** would receive training aligned to this partnership [[32]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/accenture-and-nvidia-lead-enterprises-into-era-of-ai).  
- **Deloitte × AWS** (2024): multi-year collaboration for genAI/data/analytics (SageMaker, Bedrock, Amazon Q) and explicitly referenced funding to take POCs to production; tied to Deloitte’s $2B IndustryAdvantage™ [[3]](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/press-room/deloitte-launches-gen-ai-accelerator-program-with-aws.html).  
- **PwC × Google Cloud** (2024): GenAI Innovation Lab with Gemini and Google AI infrastructure [[8]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-innovative-solutions-google-cloud-generative-ai-tools.html).  
- **PwC × OpenAI** (2024): PwC US+UK agreement making PwC OpenAI’s first ChatGPT Enterprise reseller and “largest user,” tied to its $1B investment program [[9]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-us-uk-accelerating-ai-chatgpt-enterprise-adoption.html).  
- **EY × Microsoft / Azure OpenAI** (via EY.ai): EY cites early Azure OpenAI access and deployment of genAI solutions on Azure OpenAI Services [[10]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2023/09/ey-announces-launch-of-artificial-intelligence-platform-ey-ai-following-us-1-4b-investment).  
- **KPMG × Microsoft** (2023): “multibillion” commitment phrasing (Microsoft) [[13]](https://news.microsoft.com/source/2023/07/11/kpmg-and-microsoft-enter-landmark-agreement-to-put-ai-at-the-forefront-of-professional-services/); Reuters quantified as **$2B** [[14]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/kpmg-plans-2-bln-investment-ai-cloud-services-wsj-2023-07-11/).  
- **KPMG × Google Cloud** (2024): Reuters **$100M** over four years [[16]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/kpmg-spend-100-million-ai-partnership-with-google-cloud-2024-11-20/).  
- **Capgemini × AWS** (2024): multi-year collaboration to move genAI from PoCs to production; Capgemini also tied this to training **30,000 employees** on AWS advanced technologies over three years (as part of the €2B AI investment) [[43]](https://www.capgemini.com/news/press-releases/capgemini-and-aws-expand-strategic-collaboration-to-enable-broad-enterprise-generative-ai-adoption/).  
- **BCG × Anthropic**: Anthropic announced a collaboration to bring Claude into BCG offerings and to clients (knowledge mgmt, market research, fraud detection, etc.) [[56]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-bcg).  
- **Bain × OpenAI**: expanded partnership and OpenAI Center of Excellence (no dollar figure disclosed) [[23]](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2024/bain-and-company-announces-expanded-partnership-with-openai-to-accelerate-delivery-of-ai-solutions-and-meet-fast-growing-client-needs/).

## 2) AI-driven products/platforms & how these firms are “productizing” consulting

A clear 2024–2026 shift is **from “advice + pilots” to “platforms + accelerators + agent ecosystems,”** often described as *agentic AI* plus governance.

### A. Accenture — AI Refinery + industry agent solutions + interoperability layer
- **AI Refinery** positioned as an enterprise platform to “jump-start” agentic AI journeys, available across public/private clouds, integrated with NVIDIA AI Foundry/Enterprise/Omniverse [[32]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/accenture-and-nvidia-lead-enterprises-into-era-of-ai).  
- **Trusted Agent Huddle (2025)**: multi-system agent collaboration within AI Refinery, designed for agent-to-agent interoperability across many partner ecosystems (Adobe, AWS, Databricks, Google Cloud, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake, Workday, etc.), supporting open protocols like **Agent2Agent (A2A) and MCP** and introducing ideas like certification and a future “agent trust score” [[34]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-introduces-trusted-agent-huddle-to-allow-seamless-first-of-its-kind-multi-system-ai-agent-collaboration-across-the-enterprise).  
- **Distiller agentic framework + SDKs (2025)**: enterprise-grade developer framework covering memory, orchestration, governance/observability, model eval, and cross-platform interoperability; deployable across cloud/on-prem/sovereign setups [[35]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions).  
- **AI Refinery for Industry (2025)**: collection of **industry agent solutions** intended to reduce build-to-value time “from months/weeks to days,” with plans to expand beyond the initial set [[60]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-ai-refinery-for-industry-to-reinvent-processes-and-accelerate-agentic-ai-journeys).  
- **GenWizard**: Accenture’s genAI platform for tech delivery modernization (reverse engineering, migration, platform implementations like SAP/Oracle/Salesforce/Workday), with aggressive claimed performance ranges (e.g., 5–8x faster speed-to-market, 50–75% IT cost reduction) that should be treated as vendor claims [[110]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/cloud/application-transformation/genwizard).

**Differentiation pattern:** strong emphasis on **agent ecosystems, interoperability, and industrialized delivery** (studios, hubs, SDKs), plus partner breadth and high-volume delivery [[32]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/accenture-and-nvidia-lead-enterprises-into-era-of-ai)[[34]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-introduces-trusted-agent-huddle-to-allow-seamless-first-of-its-kind-multi-system-ai-agent-collaboration-across-the-enterprise)[[35]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions).

---

### B. Deloitte — “AI Factory as a Service,” Silicon2Service, and agentic productization (ZoraAI)
- **AI Factory as a Service (2024)**: a “one-stop shop” suite of GenAI capabilities built on **NVIDIA AI** and leveraging **Oracle** enterprise AI tech, from strategy/design to deployment/optimization, with embedded governance via Deloitte’s **Trustworthy AI** framework [[66]](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/deloitte-launches-ai-factory-service-powered-by-nvidia-oracle.html).  
- **Global AI Infrastructure CoE (2025)**: supports clients building/operating specialized AI data centers; positioned as a pillar of Deloitte’s **Silicon2Service AI factory-as-a-service** offering (GPU/network/storage/cooling, digital twins, cyber/compliance, sourcing) [[68]](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/deloitte-launches-ai-infrastructure-coe-to-drive-ai-data-center-innovation-and-delivery-globally.html).  
- **Agentic network + product business (2025)**: Deloitte stated it launched a **Deloitte Global Agentic Network** and **ZoraAI™ by Deloitte** as its “first Agentic AI product business,” powered by NVIDIA and planned to integrate into major enterprise platforms [[99]](https://www.deloitte.com/mt/en/about/press-room/global-revenue-announcement.html).  
- **Quartz AI (with NVIDIA)**: cross-industry AI offerings suite; publicly visible detail in sources is limited to high-level framing and component names [[52]](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/alliances/nvidia-alliance-quartz-ai.html).

**Differentiation pattern:** Deloitte is pushing a **factory + infrastructure + trustworthy governance** narrative, and is explicitly moving into “AI product business” territory via agent suites [[66]](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/deloitte-launches-ai-factory-service-powered-by-nvidia-oracle.html)[[68]](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/deloitte-launches-ai-infrastructure-coe-to-drive-ai-data-center-innovation-and-delivery-globally.html)[[99]](https://www.deloitte.com/mt/en/about/press-room/global-revenue-announcement.html).

---

### C. PwC — agent OS + AI factory + AI assurance
- **agent OS (2025)**: positioned as an “enterprise AI command center” to orchestrate, integrate, and govern AI agents across applications/platforms; vendor-agnostic, supports agents and workflows across major clouds and enterprise systems, uses **MCP**, integrates RBAC with Microsoft Graph, includes centralized governance dashboard and human-in-the-loop controls [[45]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/ai/agent-os.html)[[46]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html).  
- PwC describes an internal ecosystem of **250+ AI agents deployed within the firm** and positions agent OS as the orchestration layer [[46]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html).  
- **Assurance for AI**: PwC’s FY2025 annual review calls this a first-of-its-kind solution for independent assurance over AI systems aligned with regulatory expectations [[98]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-annual-review/2025/pwc-global-annual-review-2025.pdf).  
- **Next Generation Audit**: network-wide AI-first audit transformation (pilots 2025; rollout starting 2026) framed as a $1B investment program [[6]](https://www.pwc.com/mu/en/about-us/global-annual-review/artificial-intelligence.html)[[7]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2025/pwc-global-revenues-rise.html).

**Differentiation pattern:** PwC is leaning into **control-plane orchestration (agent OS)** plus **trust/assurance** as a market-facing differentiator [[45]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/ai/agent-os.html)[[46]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html)[[98]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-annual-review/2025/pwc-global-annual-review-2025.pdf).

---

### D. EY — EY.ai + EYQ + agentic platform with NVIDIA (tax/assurance-heavy)
- **EY.ai**: a unifying platform combining human capabilities and AI, built on a stated $1.4B investment foundation and embedded into EY tech such as **EY Fabric** [[10]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2023/09/ey-announces-launch-of-artificial-intelligence-platform-ey-ai-following-us-1-4b-investment).  
- **EY.ai EYQ**: described as EY’s secure LLM and genAI environment, initially piloted internally then released more broadly; later described as a private genAI ecosystem supporting large-scale internal deployment [[10]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2023/09/ey-announces-launch-of-artificial-intelligence-platform-ey-ai-following-us-1-4b-investment)[[117]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/emerging-technologies/learn-how-leaders-deployed-generative-ai-for-employees).  
- **EY.ai Agentic Platform (2025, with NVIDIA AI)**: designed to scale enterprise AI agents across cloud/on-prem/edge; includes agent-level risk controls using **NeMo Guardrails** and EY SafePrompt; also includes orchestration across third-party agent platforms, model catalog (NIM + EY fine-tuned models), and “deploy anywhere” compute options [[48]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2025/03/ey-launching-ey-ai-agentic-platform-created-with-nvidia-ai-to-drive-multi-sector-transformation-starting-with-tax-risk-and-finance-domains). EY stated an initial internal deployment would integrate **150 AI agents** for **80,000 EY professionals** to address **3m tax compliance outcomes** and **30m tax processes annually** [[48]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2025/03/ey-launching-ey-ai-agentic-platform-created-with-nvidia-ai-to-drive-multi-sector-transformation-starting-with-tax-risk-and-finance-domains).  
- Assurance platform AI integration (2025): “large-scale integration” of AI into global Assurance platform, supporting **160,000+ audit engagements** [[11]](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/newsroom/2025/04/ey-announces-large-scale-integration-of-leading-edge-ai-technology-into-global-assurance-technology-platform).

**Differentiation pattern:** EY’s differentiator is **domain depth (tax/assurance/risk)**, internal scale (“client zero”), and **agentic platform engineering with NVIDIA** with embedded responsible AI controls [[11]](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/newsroom/2025/04/ey-announces-large-scale-integration-of-leading-edge-ai-technology-into-global-assurance-technology-platform)[[48]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2025/03/ey-launching-ey-ai-agentic-platform-created-with-nvidia-ai-to-drive-multi-sector-transformation-starting-with-tax-risk-and-finance-domains)[[102]](https://www.ey.com/content/dam/ey-unified-site/ey-com/en-gl/campaigns/value-realized/documents/2025/ey-value-realized-report-2025.pdf).

---

### E. KPMG — Workbench + “Services as Software,” with explicit Trusted AI/ISO posture
- **KPMG Workbench**: positioned as a single AI platform to scale adoption while maintaining “trust and control,” built on Microsoft tech (Azure AI Foundry Services), supporting “interoperable, agent-to-agent communications,” with **50 AI assistants** and “nearly a thousand” in development [[49]](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/06/kpmg-launches-a-multi-agent-ai-platform-transforming-client-delivery-and-ways-of-working-across-the-global-organization.html).  
- KPMG frames Workbench as enabling **“Services as Software (SaS)”**—codifying KPMG expertise into AI tools [[49]](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/06/kpmg-launches-a-multi-agent-ai-platform-transforming-client-delivery-and-ways-of-working-across-the-global-organization.html).  
- Strong emphasis on **data sovereignty** and governance; KPMG claims ISO/BSI **42001 certification** and a **“Trusted AI stamp”** accreditation process for agents/tools [[49]](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/06/kpmg-launches-a-multi-agent-ai-platform-transforming-client-delivery-and-ways-of-working-across-the-global-organization.html). KPMG also announced ISO 42001 certification in the US and positioned it as strengthening AI governance offerings including AI Assurance and AI Trust [[51]](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-receives-iso-ai-certification.html).

**Differentiation pattern:** KPMG is positioning itself as a **governance-first, sovereignty-aware AI platform provider** for regulated environments [[49]](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/06/kpmg-launches-a-multi-agent-ai-platform-transforming-client-delivery-and-ways-of-working-across-the-global-organization.html)[[51]](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-receives-iso-ai-certification.html).

### F. IBM Consulting — watsonx + Consulting Advantage + Enterprise Advantage (asset-based consulting)
- **watsonx** portfolio is IBM’s enterprise AI/data platform; IBM emphasized governance integration (e.g., **watsonx.governance + Amazon SageMaker**, citing EU AI Act readiness) [[37]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-05-21-IBM-Expands-watsonx-Portfolio-on-AWS,-Adds-watsonx-governance-to-Help-Clients-Scale-Responsible-AI).  
- IBM’s agentic posture includes **watsonx Orchestrate** and integrations with AWS (later: Bedrock AgentCore integration) [[39]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/blog-ibm-and-aws-strengthen-partnership-to-accelerate-enterprise-agentic-ai-across-industries).  
- **IBM Consulting Advantage**: IBM’s internal AI-powered delivery platform with a marketplace of industry-specific agents/apps; IBM claimed it supported **150+ client engagements** and boosted consultant productivity by **up to 50%** [[40]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2026-01-19-ibm-launches-enterprise-advantage-service-to-help-businesses-scale-agentic-ai).  
- **IBM Enterprise Advantage (Jan 2026)**: “asset-based consulting service” to help clients build, govern, and operate their own internal AI platform, compatible with AWS/GCP/Azure/watsonx and open/closed models—explicitly “scale agentic applications without changing cloud providers/models” [[40]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2026-01-19-ibm-launches-enterprise-advantage-service-to-help-businesses-scale-agentic-ai).  
- IBM’s 2025–2026 AWS partnership announcements also describe **ContextForge** (an MCP gateway/registry), “IBM Bob” AI-first IDE, and packaged agentic modernization frameworks distributed via AWS Marketplace [[39]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/blog-ibm-and-aws-strengthen-partnership-to-accelerate-enterprise-agentic-ai-across-industries).

**Differentiation pattern:** IBM is pushing **platform + governance + asset-based delivery** and leaning into hybrid/multi-cloud, regulated enterprise needs [[37]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-05-21-IBM-Expands-watsonx-Portfolio-on-AWS,-Adds-watsonx-governance-to-Help-Clients-Scale-Responsible-AI)[[39]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/blog-ibm-and-aws-strengthen-partnership-to-accelerate-enterprise-agentic-ai-across-industries)[[40]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2026-01-19-ibm-launches-enterprise-advantage-service-to-help-businesses-scale-agentic-ai).

### G. Capgemini — RAISE + “GenAI factory in the agentic age” + PoC-to-production tooling
- **Capgemini RAISE**: framed as a modular accelerator/foundation to build, integrate, and operate agentic AI at scale (accelerate/build/integrate/operate), explicitly addressing governance, monitoring, and responsible AI guardrails [[42]](https://www.capgemini.com/solutions/raise-reliable-ai-solution-engineering/).  
- **Agentic AI for Enterprise**: describes off-the-shelf agents, custom agents, and embedded agents; mentions an “agentic gallery” and claims partnership with NVIDIA to build **100+ bespoke agent-driven solutions** across industries [[41]](https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/solutions/solutions-agentic-ai-for-enterprise-by-capgemini/).  
- **AWS collaboration (2024)**: emphasizes moving from pilots to production at scale using Amazon Bedrock; includes techniques like LLM cascading and prompt tuning to reduce compute/TCO and potentially carbon intensity; commits to training **30,000 employees** on AWS advanced tech over three years (aligned to €2B investment) [[43]](https://www.capgemini.com/news/press-releases/capgemini-and-aws-expand-strategic-collaboration-to-enable-broad-enterprise-generative-ai-adoption/).

**Differentiation pattern:** Capgemini leans into **industrialization and operations (Operate pillar)**, cost/TCO optimization, and an explicit “factory” approach to scaling agentic AI [[42]](https://www.capgemini.com/solutions/raise-reliable-ai-solution-engineering/)[[43]](https://www.capgemini.com/news/press-releases/capgemini-and-aws-expand-strategic-collaboration-to-enable-broad-enterprise-generative-ai-adoption/).

### H. MBB (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) — internal platforms, build & design units, and partner-led model access
- **McKinsey — “Lilli”**: internal genAI knowledge platform (firmwide rollout July 2023) with stated adoption/usage at scale and claimed time savings; McKinsey says it can share a customizable version of Lilli’s underlying architecture with clients and build specialized knowledge agents [[53]](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/how-we-help-clients/rewiring-the-way-mckinsey-works-with-lilli).  
- **BCG — BCG X + AI Science Institute**: BCG X is BCG’s build/design/tech division; BCG launched **BCG X AI Science Institute** (2025) to accelerate AI-powered scientific discovery with industry/government R&D teams [[55]](https://www.bcg.com/press/15april2025-bcg-x-launches-ai-science-institute).  
- **Bain — OpenAI Center of Excellence + ecosystem**: Bain expanded its OpenAI partnership and is investing in an OpenAI CoE to co-design industry solutions (initially retail and healthcare life sciences) and deploy ChatGPT Enterprise internally [[23]](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2024/bain-and-company-announces-expanded-partnership-with-openai-to-accelerate-delivery-of-ai-solutions-and-meet-fast-growing-client-needs/).

**Differentiation pattern:** MBB generally emphasizes **strategy-to-execution** plus build units (BCG X) and internal platforms (Lilli) and partner ecosystems, but the sourced material is less “product spec” and more **operating model + capability + partnership** [[23]](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2024/bain-and-company-announces-expanded-partnership-with-openai-to-accelerate-delivery-of-ai-solutions-and-meet-fast-growing-client-needs/)[[53]](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/how-we-help-clients/rewiring-the-way-mckinsey-works-with-lilli)[[55]](https://www.bcg.com/press/15april2025-bcg-x-launches-ai-science-institute).

## 3) Published client case studies & measurable outputs since 2023 (what’s quantified, what’s production)

The availability of *named-client, quantified* case studies varies widely by firm in the captured sources. Below are the strongest examples with measurable outputs.

### A. Accenture — strong internal metrics + selected named external scaling indicators
- **Accenture internal Marketing + Communications reinvention** (agentic): integrated AI Refinery and used **14 specialized AI agents** for **954 marketers**; reported **~30% reduction in manual tasks** and **25–55% faster speed-to-market**, plus earlier waves reporting 60% reduction in internal comms and 50% reduction in external content while improving external brand value by 25% [[33]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/industry/cross-industry/document/Making-Reinvention-Real-With-GenAI-TL.pdf).  
- **Repsol** (named; agentic AI): Accenture reports **22 custom AI agents already support production use cases**, with a plan to scale to **90 agents** and **3,000+ employees**, on a secure cloud data core [[61]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-4/Annual-Report-2025.pdf).  
- **Unilever** (named; program announcement): Unilever CEO cited **500 AI applications** already introduced; Accenture referenced using GenWizard to accelerate digital product development (no quantified incremental outcomes in the release) [[91]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/unilever-and-accenture-join-forces-to-establish-a-new-industry-standard-in-generative-ai-powered-productivity).  
- Accenture’s research report contains **quantified but anonymized** examples (3M hours saved; 16M hyper-personalized offers; underwriting workflow early results “up to 10% revenue increase possible”)—useful as scenario signals but weaker as verifiable case studies [[62]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-2/Accenture-Reinvention-in-the-age-of-generative-AI-Report.pdf).

**Production signal strength:** High for Accenture internal + Repsol (explicit “production use cases”) [[33]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/industry/cross-industry/document/Making-Reinvention-Real-With-GenAI-TL.pdf)[[61]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-4/Annual-Report-2025.pdf); moderate for other examples [[91]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/unilever-and-accenture-join-forces-to-establish-a-new-industry-standard-in-generative-ai-powered-productivity)[[62]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-2/Accenture-Reinvention-in-the-age-of-generative-AI-Report.pdf).

## 4) Common AI application scenarios emphasized (cross-industry) + what “good” implementation looks like

Across the firms, the emphasized scenarios converge strongly. Differences show up in **which functions they lead with** (audit/tax vs ops vs product/R&D) and **how they package delivery** (platforms, factories, agent OS/workbench/refinery).

### A. High-priority scenarios (recurring across firms)
1. **Customer service & contact centers**
   - Capgemini: digital contact center + Copilot driving wrap-up time down ~50% [[87]](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Eneco-eMobility-client-story-case-study.pdf).

### B. “Reference architecture” patterns these firms repeatedly recommend (even when not presented as formal diagrams)

Across sources, the common blueprint is:

- **A platform/control plane** to orchestrate multi-agent workflows (Accenture AI Refinery + Trusted Agent Huddle [[34]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-introduces-trusted-agent-huddle-to-allow-seamless-first-of-its-kind-multi-system-ai-agent-collaboration-across-the-enterprise), PwC agent OS [[46]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html), KPMG Workbench [[49]](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/06/kpmg-launches-a-multi-agent-ai-platform-transforming-client-delivery-and-ways-of-working-across-the-global-organization.html), EY agentic platform [[48]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2025/03/ey-launching-ey-ai-agentic-platform-created-with-nvidia-ai-to-drive-multi-sector-transformation-starting-with-tax-risk-and-finance-domains), IBM Enterprise Advantage and ContextForge/MCP gateway [[40]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2026-01-19-ibm-launches-enterprise-advantage-service-to-help-businesses-scale-agentic-ai)[[39]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/blog-ibm-and-aws-strengthen-partnership-to-accelerate-enterprise-agentic-ai-across-industries)).  
- **RAG + enterprise data readiness** as a practical default for enterprise genAI (explicit in TE Connectivity solution [[86]](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TE-Connectivity-knowledge-hub-client-story-case-study.pdf); EY RAG-at-scale pattern [[117]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/emerging-technologies/learn-how-leaders-deployed-generative-ai-for-employees)).  
- **Governance + guardrails + observability** as a first-class layer, not an afterthought:
  - Model risk and compliance workflows (IBM watsonx.governance + SageMaker with audit trails [[37]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-05-21-IBM-Expands-watsonx-Portfolio-on-AWS,-Adds-watsonx-governance-to-Help-Clients-Scale-Responsible-AI))

## 5) Strategic directions (2025–2026): where these firms are steering AI

### A. From “GenAI copilots” to **agentic AI** and “digital workforces”
This is arguably the dominant strategic direction across 2025–2026.

- **Accenture**: explicitly frames “advanced AI” as genAI + **agentic + physical AI**, and states it is reinventing “what we sell” and “how we deliver,” reporting strong FY2025 advanced AI revenue/bookings [[61]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-4/Annual-Report-2025.pdf). Its platform roadmap (Trusted Agent Huddle, distiller framework) is aimed at multi-agent orchestration and interoperability [[34]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-introduces-trusted-agent-huddle-to-allow-seamless-first-of-its-kind-multi-system-ai-agent-collaboration-across-the-enterprise)[[35]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions).  
- **Deloitte**: emphasizes **Agentic AI and multi-agent systems** and launched an Agentic Network and ZoraAI product business [[99]](https://www.deloitte.com/mt/en/about/press-room/global-revenue-announcement.html). Deloitte research highlights that only a minority have mature agent governance and that many agent implementations fail if layered onto old workflows rather than redesigning operations [[100]](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html)[[101]](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/press-room/state-of-ai-report-2026.html).  
- **PwC**: positions agent OS as the “central nervous system/switchboard” to connect and scale agents into workflows [[46]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html).  
- **EY**: positions EY.ai Agentic Platform with NVIDIA to scale enterprise agents, initially focusing on tax/compliance process scale and later broader sectors [[48]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2025/03/ey-launching-ey-ai-agentic-platform-created-with-nvidia-ai-to-drive-multi-sector-transformation-starting-with-tax-risk-and-finance-domains).  
- **IBM**: positions agentic AI as the next transformation wave, with Enterprise Advantage aimed at scaling agentic applications without changing clouds/models; IBM also emphasized open standards and interoperability (MCP/A2A) in its broader narrative [[40]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2026-01-19-ibm-launches-enterprise-advantage-service-to-help-businesses-scale-agentic-ai)[[107]](https://www.ibm.com/think/news/year-agentic-ai-center-stage-2025).  
- **Capgemini**: RAISE positioned as “Gen AI factory in the agentic age” and Capgemini Research emphasizes autonomy levels, orchestration, guardrails, and human-agent teaming [[42]](https://www.capgemini.com/solutions/raise-reliable-ai-solution-engineering/)[[108]](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Final-Web-Version-Report-AI-Agents.pdf).  
- **KPMG**: Workbench is framed as multi-agent, interoperable, sovereignty-ready, and stamped/certified for trust [[49]](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/06/kpmg-launches-a-multi-agent-ai-platform-transforming-client-delivery-and-ways-of-working-across-the-global-organization.html).

### B. “Trust” as product: responsible AI, assurance, governance maturity
A second strategic convergence is that **governance is becoming a sellable layer**—not only a risk requirement.

- **PwC**: “Assurance for AI” and heavy messaging that trust is key for adoption and regulatory alignment [[98]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-annual-review/2025/pwc-global-annual-review-2025.pdf).  
- **KPMG**: ISO 42001 certification and “Trusted AI stamp” posture as a differentiator [[49]](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/06/kpmg-launches-a-multi-agent-ai-platform-transforming-client-delivery-and-ways-of-working-across-the-global-organization.html)[[51]](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-receives-iso-ai-certification.html).  
- **IBM**: governance integrations positioned as enablers of compliance (EU AI Act cited) and multi-model governance [[37]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-05-21-IBM-Expands-watsonx-Portfolio-on-AWS,-Adds-watsonx-governance-to-Help-Clients-Scale-Responsible-AI).  
- **EY**: embedded responsibility/veracity/transparency/reliability principles, SafePrompt, NeMo Guardrails [[48]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2025/03/ey-launching-ey-ai-agentic-platform-created-with-nvidia-ai-to-drive-multi-sector-transformation-starting-with-tax-risk-and-finance-domains).  
- **Deloitte**: Trustworthy AI is consistently presented as embedded into factory offerings and scaling [[66]](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/deloitte-launches-ai-factory-service-powered-by-nvidia-oracle.html)[[99]](https://www.deloitte.com/mt/en/about/press-room/global-revenue-announcement.html)[[101]](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/press-room/state-of-ai-report-2026.html).  
- **Accenture**: agent trust scoring and certification direction in Trusted Agent Huddle [[34]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-introduces-trusted-agent-huddle-to-allow-seamless-first-of-its-kind-multi-system-ai-agent-collaboration-across-the-enterprise).

### C. Industry specialization + “reinvention” framing
- **Accenture**: “reinvention partner” language and an integrated Reinvention Services unit intended to embed AI across offerings [[57]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-4/accenture-360-value-report-2025-custom.pdf).  
- **PwC**: reinvention is framed as “strategy for growth,” with AI factories, hubs/CoEs, and agent OS central to the story [[98]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-annual-review/2025/pwc-global-annual-review-2025.pdf).  
- **EY**: new “All in” strategy; emphasizes industry experience + 100,000 technologists and ecosystem leverage [[102]](https://www.ey.com/content/dam/ey-unified-site/ey-com/en-gl/campaigns/value-realized/documents/2025/ey-value-realized-report-2025.pdf).  
- **Deloitte**: positions itself as uniquely positioned to help clients capture AI’s potential; elevates sovereign AI and AI infrastructure demand [[99]](https://www.deloitte.com/mt/en/about/press-room/global-revenue-announcement.html)[[101]](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/press-room/state-of-ai-report-2026.html).

### D. Ecosystem alliances as the default scaling model (not “single-stack”)
Nearly every firm emphasizes being **cloud/model agnostic** in the control plane while partnering deeply for delivery.

- Accenture Trusted Agent Huddle partner breadth [[34]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-introduces-trusted-agent-huddle-to-allow-seamless-first-of-its-kind-multi-system-ai-agent-collaboration-across-the-enterprise).  
- PwC agent OS vendor list and cloud-agnostic deployment claims [[45]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/ai/agent-os.html)[[46]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html).  
- IBM Enterprise Advantage explicitly listing AWS/GCP/Azure/watsonx + open/closed models [[40]](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2026-01-19-ibm-launches-enterprise-advantage-service-to-help-businesses-scale-agentic-ai).  
- Capgemini AWS partnership and multi-hyperscaler posture [[43]](https://www.capgemini.com/news/press-releases/capgemini-and-aws-expand-strategic-collaboration-to-enable-broad-enterprise-generative-ai-adoption/).  
- Deloitte’s alliance-driven POC-to-production funding with AWS [[3]](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/press-room/deloitte-launches-gen-ai-accelerator-program-with-aws.html).  
- EY’s alliance ecosystem and NVIDIA agentic build [[47]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/services/ai/platform)[[48]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2025/03/ey-launching-ey-ai-agentic-platform-created-with-nvidia-ai-to-drive-multi-sector-transformation-starting-with-tax-risk-and-finance-domains).

## 8) What’s missing / how to interpret the numbers responsibly (important caveats)

1. **Investment figures are not standardized.** Some are explicit “AI investment budgets” (Accenture $3B [[1]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2023/accenture-to-invest-3-billion-in-ai-to-accelerate-clients-reinvention), Capgemini €2B [[29]](https://www.capgemini.com/in-en/news/press-releases/capgemini-reports-strong-half-year-performance-robust-growth-and-improved-operating-margin/), Deloitte $2B IndustryAdvantage [[2]](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deloitte-invests-2-billion-to-accelerate-industryadvantage-for-its-clients-302108115.html)), while others are **partnership spending commitments** (KPMG $2B with Microsoft [[14]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/kpmg-plans-2-bln-investment-ai-cloud-services-wsj-2023-07-11/)) or **capability investments** (PwC network $1.5B [[6]](https://www.pwc.com/mu/en/about-us/global-annual-review/artificial-intelligence.html)[[7]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2025/pwc-global-revenues-rise.html)) or **service-line programs** (EY assurance $1B [[11]](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/newsroom/2025/04/ey-announces-large-scale-integration-of-leading-edge-ai-technology-into-global-assurance-technology-platform), PwC Next Gen Audit $1B [[6]](https://www.pwc.com/mu/en/about-us/global-annual-review/artificial-intelligence.html)[[7]](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2025/pwc-global-revenues-rise.html)). These are not apples-to-apples.

2. **Case-study metrics vary in auditability.**  
   - Stronger: operational usage data and measured savings (Fairview 16k uses/1k hours saved [[79]](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/case-studies/your-orthopedist-may-see-your-knee-but-only-your-primary-care-physician-sees-the-big-picture.html); TE Connectivity ingestion and adoption scale [[86]](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TE-Connectivity-knowledge-hub-client-story-case-study.pdf); PwC Southwest quantified time reductions [[80]](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ghosts/ai-analytics/southwest-ai-software-update.html); IBM support deployment scale [[92]](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-software-support)).  
   - Weaker: anonymized examples or “expected/projected” benefits (some IBM projections [[92]](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-software-support), Accenture anonymized examples and “up to” language [[62]](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-2/Accenture-Reinvention-in-the-age-of-generative-AI-Report.pdf)).

3. **Agentic AI claims are rapidly evolving.** Many offerings emphasize interoperability standards (MCP/A2A) and agent governance but are early; Deloitte’s own research notes many agent implementations fail if workflows aren’t redesigned [[100]](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html).

If you want, I can also:
1) build a **side-by-side matrix** (rows = firms; columns = investment, platforms, governance posture, industries, talent metrics, top case studies), or  
2) extract a **catalog of application scenarios by industry** (FS, healthcare, manufacturing, public sector) using only the sourced examples above.
