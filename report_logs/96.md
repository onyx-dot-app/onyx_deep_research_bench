ANSWER:
## 1) 2024–early 2026 market signals and what they imply for product roadmaps

### 1.1 Shipments and category momentum: “flat units, shifting mix”
- **Global unit shipments are in a low-growth phase in 2024, with a modest rebound expected in 2025.** IDC projects worldwide smart home device shipments to be essentially flat in 2024 (+0.6% YoY to **892.3M** units), improving to **+4.4%** growth in 2025 (**931.1M**), with the rebound **driven by emerging markets**; IDC also projects **5.6% CAGR (2024–2028)** to **1.1B units** by 2028 [[1]](https://www.telecompaper.com/news/smart-home-device-market-to-stay-flat-in-2024-grow-4-next-year-idc--1514312)[[2]](https://backendnews.net/idc-emerging-regions-to-boost-smart-home-market-growth-by-2025/).  
- **Security devices are becoming the volume anchor of “next purchases.”** IDC (as reported) says **home security products (connected cameras + door locks) exceed 25% of total shipments** and are becoming the most popular category [[2]](https://backendnews.net/idc-emerging-regions-to-boost-smart-home-market-growth-by-2025/). This is a strong signal that “smart home journeys” increasingly expand via additional cameras/locks rather than additional speakers/TV-like endpoints [[2]](https://backendnews.net/idc-emerging-regions-to-boost-smart-home-market-growth-by-2025/).  
- **Smart speakers are cooling, and roadmaps are simplifying.** IDC expects **smart speakers to decline 8.8% in 2024**, with a minor recovery afterward; it also notes Google and Amazon are prioritizing **basic voice input and fewer additional features**—a key roadmap signal that speakers are shifting from “feature race” to “utility endpoint / assistant access node” [[2]](https://backendnews.net/idc-emerging-regions-to-boost-smart-home-market-growth-by-2025/).  
- **Lighting remains a growth pocket.** Counterpoint’s Q2 2024 tracker overview reports overall smart device shipments were almost flat (-1% YoY), but **smart lights grew double-digit YoY**, while **smart speakers and smart cameras declined** [[3]](https://counterpointresearch.com/en/reports/global-smart-devices-shipments-tracker-q1-2021-q2-2024). Even with limited details, this directional split is meaningful: lighting tends to benefit from lower price points, clearer day-one value, and “works with everything” expectations.

**Implication for development:** In a slower replacement-cycle environment (notably in mature markets), product teams tend to win by (a) targeting categories with clear ROI/value (security, energy, core convenience), and (b) reducing setup friction and platform fragmentation rather than adding “novelty” features.

---

### 1.2 Revenue and adoption: “penetration rising; premiumization depends on use case + trust”
- **Revenue growth continues even when unit growth slows.** NIQ reports that in the **EU7**, smart home revenue in **H1 2024** was **$13.9B**, **+6.5% YoY**, even as broader consumer tech demand was softer—framing connectivity as a driver of **premiumization** when the use case is compelling [[8]](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/smart-home-2024-the-demand-and-price-dynamics-shaping-the-market/).  
- **Household penetration is forecast very high in major definitions, but definitions vary.** Statista projects smart home revenue of **$193.5B in 2026**, rising to **$250.6B by 2029**, and household penetration **82.1% in 2026 → 92.5% by 2029** (Statista’s definition includes multiple segments and services; smart TVs are excluded) [[6]](https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/smart-home/worldwide).  
- **Barriers are consistent globally: cost first, privacy second.** NIQ finds **cost is the top barrier** (even for high-income consumers), with **privacy concerns** a core obstacle—especially for voice assistants and security devices [[8]](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/smart-home-2024-the-demand-and-price-dynamics-shaping-the-market/).  
- **Consumers pay more when benefits are concrete.** NIQ reports willingness to pay “a bit more” is notably higher in **security, lighting, energy, health/personal care** (about **4 in 10** consumers) [[8]](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/smart-home-2024-the-demand-and-price-dynamics-shaping-the-market/). Where smart variants clearly improve convenience/performance or reduce energy use, premiumization holds better; where value is ambiguous, adoption stalls [[8]](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/smart-home-2024-the-demand-and-price-dynamics-shaping-the-market/).

**Implication for development:** The next wave of products must (1) justify price with measurable benefits (security outcomes, energy savings, convenience automation), and (2) build trust via privacy/security transparency and durable update/support commitments.

### 1.3 Regional structure: point solutions dominate, but “whole-home” systems are monetizing
Berg Insight (via IoT Now) provides an unusually clear “systems in use” snapshot:
- **North America (end of 2024):** **305.8M smart home systems installed**, split into **241.4M point solutions** vs **64.4M multifunction/whole-home**; that maps to **66.7M smart homes** (some homes run multiple systems) = **44.8% of households** [[9]](https://www.iot-now.com/2026/01/23/155076-139-million-homes-in-europe-and-north-america-were-smart-at-the-end-of-2024/). Revenues: **$52.4B in 2024**, forecast to **$81.8B by 2029** (9.3% CAGR) [[9]](https://www.iot-now.com/2026/01/23/155076-139-million-homes-in-europe-and-north-america-were-smart-at-the-end-of-2024/).  
- **Europe (EU27+3, end of 2024):** **240.1M systems** total (**193.7M point solutions**, **46.4M whole-home**), mapping to **72.8M smart homes** = **30.7% of households** [[9]](https://www.iot-now.com/2026/01/23/155076-139-million-homes-in-europe-and-north-america-were-smart-at-the-end-of-2024/). Revenues: **€39.3B in 2024**, forecast **€68.3B by 2029** (11.7% CAGR) [[9]](https://www.iot-now.com/2026/01/23/155076-139-million-homes-in-europe-and-north-america-were-smart-at-the-end-of-2024/).  
- Berg notes point solutions often represent the **first purchase**, listing common entry products: thermostats, bulbs, plugs, cameras, speakers, floor-cleaning robots [[9]](https://www.iot-now.com/2026/01/23/155076-139-million-homes-in-europe-and-north-america-were-smart-at-the-end-of-2024/).

**Implication for development:** The volume business is still point solutions, but the growth in monetizable “whole-home” value increasingly comes from platforms that unify security, energy, and automation—often via service providers (security companies, ISPs) bundling services with devices [[9]](https://www.iot-now.com/2026/01/23/155076-139-million-homes-in-europe-and-north-america-were-smart-at-the-end-of-2024/).

## 2) Interoperability and platform dynamics: where product development is heading

### 2.1 Matter’s expansion is redefining what “baseline compatibility” means
Matter’s trajectory from late 2023 to late 2024 is less about marketing and more about expanding *device coverage* + *UX primitives*:

- **Matter 1.2 (Oct 2023):** Adds major appliances and home health/safety categories—e.g., **robot vacuums**, **smoke/CO alarms**, **air quality sensors**, **air purifiers**, **fans**, plus dishwashers, fridges, room AC, washers [[20]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-2-arrives-with-nine-new-device-types-improvements-across-the-board/). It also introduces modeling improvements like **Device & Endpoint Composition** and **Semantic Tags** (key for consistent UI/automation across apps) [[20]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-2-arrives-with-nine-new-device-types-improvements-across-the-board/).  
- **Matter 1.3 (May 2024):** Adds **energy reporting**, **EV charging (EVSE)**, **water management** (leak/freeze sensors, rain sensors, water valves), plus more appliances (ovens, microwaves, cooktops, hoods, dryers) [[21]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-3-specification-released/). Critically, it introduces **Scenes** (standardized) and **Command Batching** to improve multi-device responsiveness and reduce the “popcorn effect” in lighting [[21]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-3-specification-released/).  
- **Matter 1.4 (Nov 2024):** Focuses on (a) cross-ecosystem experience and (b) infrastructure reliability:
  - **Enhanced Multi-Admin** to reduce the pain of sharing devices across ecosystems [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).  
  - **Home Routers and Access Points (HRAP)**—Matter-certifiable routers/APs that include a Wi‑Fi AP + Thread Border Router and a secure directory for storing/sharing Thread credentials to reduce Thread network fragmentation [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).  
  - Expanded energy device types (**solar/inverters, batteries/BESS, heat pumps, water heaters**) and energy management controls [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).  
  - **Occupancy sensing enhancements** supporting modalities like **radar, vision, ambient sensing**, and groundwork for future person detection/activity classification [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).  
  - Battery-life improvements for low-power devices via **Intermittently Connected Devices (ICDs)** features such as Long Idle Time and Check-In protocol [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).

**What this means for future products:** “Matter-compatible” will increasingly imply not only basic control, but consistent multi-platform onboarding, multi-device scene execution, better battery life, and standardized energy telemetry—shaping everything from hardware BOM choices to software QA and certification strategy.

---

### 2.2 Thread and Wi‑Fi infrastructure are being productized, not assumed
A major pain point in the Thread/Matter era has been **multiple, fragmented Thread meshes** created by different border routers. The industry response is concrete:

- **Thread 1.4 (Sept 2024)** introduces **Thread Credentials Sharing**, diagnostics, and infrastructure integration improvements, explicitly aimed at improving border-router interoperability and onboarding success [[25]](https://www.threadgroup.org/Portals/0/Documents/Thread_1.4_Features_White_Paper_September_2024.pdf)[[26]](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235097/thread-1-4-spec-launch-matter-smart-home-problems). The Thread 1.4 white paper details a secure passcode-based method (QR / numeric) to grant temporary credential access for commissioning and to avoid forming new, separate Thread networks [[25]](https://www.threadgroup.org/Portals/0/Documents/Thread_1.4_Features_White_Paper_September_2024.pdf).  
- Matter 1.4’s **HRAP** device type directly aligns: the router/AP becomes part of the certified Matter fabric and standardizes secure Thread credential storage/sharing to reduce fragmentation [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).  
- The **Wi‑Fi Alliance “Wi‑Fi for Matter”** certification for access points bundles capabilities (Wi‑Fi CERTIFIED 6 plus Extended Sleep and ARP/NDP proxy features) intended to ensure infrastructure supports Matter’s reliability and low-power needs at scale [[32]](https://www.wi-fi.org/file/wi-fi-matter-highlights).

**Product development shift:** Expect more “smart home-grade” routers/APs explicitly marketed and certified for Matter/Thread, and more device makers to assume robust infrastructure features (sleep behavior, proxying, credential sharing) rather than building workarounds.

---

### 2.3 Ecosystem strategies: Apple, Google, Amazon converge on hubs—yet differ on control planes
- **Apple:** Apple Home requires a **home hub to add Matter accessories**; Thread-enabled Matter accessories require a **Thread-enabled home hub** (e.g., HomePod mini, compatible Apple TV 4K) or a supported third-party border router [[28]](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102557). Apple documents Thread-capable devices and indicates some iPhones (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro-class with iOS 18+) can pair Thread accessories [[27]](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102078).  
- **Google:** Positions many Nest/Google devices as “hubs for Matter,” emphasizes **sharing control across platforms**, and promotes Android **Fast Pair for Matter** to simplify onboarding [[29]](https://home.google.com/get-inspired/matter-and-thread/).  
- **Amazon:** Frames Matter as enabling **local connectivity to Alexa** (lower latency, better reliability) without separate hubs/skills; Echo/eero devices can act as Thread border routers and Alexa uses BLE for commissioning and credential transfer [[30]](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/matter-support.html).

**Net trend:** Hubs aren’t going away; they are becoming *more standardized* (Matter controllers + Thread border routers), and the competitive layer shifts upward into AI/automation, security services, and energy optimization.

---

### 2.4 Certification economics are being fixed—enabling faster iteration
A practical but important development: the cost/time burden of Matter certification and *recertification* was inhibiting updates. Industry reporting indicates CSA introduced:
- A **Portfolio Program** to simplify certification across product families, and  
- A **Fast Track Program** to speed recertification and reduce costs, including self-check flows and “without additional fees” recertification in some cases [[13]](https://matter-smarthome.de/en/development/the-matter-standard-2025-taking-stock/).

**Implication:** Faster firmware iteration (including security updates) becomes more viable—supporting “evergreen” products and accelerating feature delivery.

---

## 3) AI in the smart home: from voice commands to multimodal, agentic, and contextual control

### 3.1 LLM assistants are pushing three capabilities into mainstream roadmaps
**(A) Natural language → structured automation**
- Google’s **“Help me create”** uses Gemini to convert a user request into an automation (starters/conditions/actions) and allows editing before saving; it’s tied to Google Home Premium in supported regions [[52]](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15684131).  
- Samsung describes SmartThings “Home AI” concepts that infer activities and trigger routines, and even uses “Generative AI in Map View” to build a home map from images for more intuitive control [[42]](https://blog.smartthings.com/roundups/samsung-smartthings-introduces-new-ai-features-at-unpacked/).

**(B) Multimodal understanding (especially cameras) → searchable home history**
- Google’s Gemini camera features include **AI descriptions**, **AI notifications**, **Home Brief** summaries, and **natural-language video search** (“Ask Home”) across camera history—again packaged via Google Home Premium/Advanced tiers and governed by eligibility/consent constraints [[50]](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15542305).  
- Google’s 2025 Nest camera refresh explicitly ties improved hardware (2K HDR, image detail) to better “semantic scene understanding” and richer alerts/search [[48]](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/devices/google-nest/new-nest-cams-home-speaker-walmart/)[[49]](https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Introducing-new-2K-Nest-Cams-and-Doorbell-with-Gemini-for-Home/ba-p/749756).

**(C) Agentic task completion**
- Amazon’s **Alexa+** positions the assistant as action-oriented and **agentic**, able to orchestrate across many services/devices and even navigate the web to complete tasks, while highlighting “grounding” to improve accuracy and a routing layer across multiple LLMs [[37]](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence)[[44]](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-tech-generative-artificial-intelligence). Alexa+ is priced as a subscription ($19.99/month) but bundled free for Prime members [[37]](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence).

**Product implication:** The new “must-have” differentiators are shifting from (1) basic voice control to (2) automation authoring, (3) summarization and retrieval of home events, and (4) trusted action execution.

---

### 3.2 Edge vs cloud: product lines will bifurcate, not converge
There is no single architecture winning; instead, product portfolios are segmenting:

- **Cloud-heavy intelligence** (scale, capability, subscriptions):
  - Alexa+ is built on cloud LLMs via Amazon Bedrock, with explicit model routing for latency/accuracy tradeoffs [[44]](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-tech-generative-artificial-intelligence), and is positioned as a subscription service [[37]](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence).  
  - Google Home Premium gates Gemini automation creation and advanced camera intelligence behind monthly plans [[38]](https://home.google.com/get-inspired/bring-home-the-magic-of-gemini/)[[52]](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15684131)[[50]](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15542305).
- **Local-first / privacy-forward intelligence** (control, resilience, enthusiast adoption, some mainstream pull):
  - Home Assistant emphasizes fully local voice pipelines, offering fast “Speech-to-Phrase” for sub-second command recognition on low-power hardware [[55]](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/) and optional LLM fallback [[55]](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/). Its Voice Preview Edition hardware includes a physical mic mute switch and supports fully local processing or “privacy-first cloud” offload [[54]](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/).  
  - Samsung claims Ambient Sensing insights are stored **locally on the home network** and frames this as privacy/performance foundation (noting these are rollout plans across 2025–2026) [[42]](https://blog.smartthings.com/roundups/samsung-smartthings-introduces-new-ai-features-at-unpacked/).

**Product implication:** Expect two “AI smart home” product families:
1) subscription-centric, cloud-processed “premium intelligence,” and  
2) local/edge-centric, privacy-resilient “trusted control,” with constrained models and explicit user control.

---

### 3.3 Ambient sensing becomes a first-class feature (not just “motion sensors”)
AI shifts sensing from binary triggers to contextual inference:
- Matter 1.4 explicitly upgrades **occupancy sensing** with support for modalities like **radar, vision, ambient sensing**, sensitivity settings, and improved tuning/reporting—laying groundwork for future person detection and activity classification [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).  
- Samsung’s Ambient Sensing vision uses “human movements and ambient sounds” across connected devices to infer activities (sleeping, exercising, cooking) and adapt routines [[39]](https://news.samsung.com/uk/samsung-expands-ai-for-all-vision-at-ces-2025-to-bring-ai-everyday-everywhere)[[42]](https://blog.smartthings.com/roundups/samsung-smartthings-introduces-new-ai-features-at-unpacked/).  
- Commercial sensing examples like Aqara’s **mmWave presence sensors** emphasize zone-based presence, multi-person detection, and privacy positioning (“no camera”), alongside claims of local automations [[56]](https://us.aqara.com/products/presence-sensor-fp2).

**Product implication:** “Presence” becomes a platform primitive that unlocks energy savings, security confidence, and frictionless automation—likely to be embedded in more devices (displays, speakers, thermostats, routers) rather than sold only as stand-alone sensors.

---

## 4) Energy, electrification, and grid-interactive homes: the next major platform war

### 4.1 Matter is moving energy from “vendor ecosystems” toward interoperable building blocks
CSA explicitly states energy management is becoming a top adoption driver and that Matter 1.4 expands energy management to reduce bills via automation [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/). Matter’s roadmap here is clear:

- **Matter 1.3:** energy reporting (power/voltage/current; consumption/generation over time), EVSE control, water management sensors/valves [[21]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-3-specification-released/).  
- **Matter 1.4:** adds device types for **solar/inverters**, **batteries/BESS**, **heat pumps**, **water heaters**, plus enhancements for EVSE preferences, thermostat schedules/presets, and **Device Energy Management** (devices shifting start times based on forecasts or grid constraints) [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).

**Product implication:** Energy features will increasingly be expected at the “works across platforms” layer (telemetry, flexibility modes), not only inside proprietary apps.

---

### 4.2 Demand response and VPP participation is expanding beyond thermostats
- **Google Nest** frames demand response as a mature tool (thermostat adjustments during “rush hours”) and reports **110+ utility partnerships** in the US/Canada and **1M+ actively enrolled customers** (end of 2023) [[64]](https://sustainability.google/stories/nest-demand-response/). It cites contributions like **75 MW peak reduction** during California’s 2022 heat wave, and explains opt-out/override mechanics [[64]](https://sustainability.google/stories/nest-demand-response/).  
- **Samsung SmartThings Flex Connect** signals a broader device approach: launched in CA/NY (July 2024), expanded to Texas (Dec 2024), and PJM (March 2025), enabling DR events across **thermostats, plugs, air conditioners, lights, TVs, appliances** through SmartThings Energy enrollment and user-chosen automations [[65]](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-smartthings-flex-connect-expands-reach-maximize-energy-savings-rewards/).

**Product implication:** DR/VPP readiness will become a mainstream requirement not only for thermostats, but for flexible loads and appliance classes—especially as platforms and aggregators monetize flexibility.

---

### 4.3 Dynamic tariffs + automation create “energy-native” smart home bundles
- **Tesla Electric Dynamic (Texas)**: time-varying pricing (on-peak vs off-peak windows), real-time market price export for Powerwall/solar with compensation linked to ERCOT prices, and VPP credits per Powerwall [[67]](https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-electric/dynamic).  
- **Octopus (UK)**: productizes EV charging, battery control, heat-pump usage shaping, and solar export via smart tariffs (e.g., Agile wholesale-based pricing; Intelligent tariffs for EVs and batteries; Cosy for heat pumps) [[68]](https://octopus.energy/octopus-smart-tariffs/).

**Product implication:** Smart home product design (especially EV charging, water heating, HVAC, storage) will increasingly assume time-of-use and real-time pricing signals—and ship with built-in scheduling/optimization UX.

---

### 4.4 Smart panels and “service point control” emerge as a crucial electrification enabler
SPAN positions the electrical panel as both:
- a way to integrate high-current appliances (EV charging, electric HVAC) **without service upgrades**, via its UL-listed “PowerUp” power control system [[72]](https://www.span.io/utilities), and  
- a grid flexibility interface where utilities can set a temporary “dynamic service rating” during peak events for transformer/system balancing [[72]](https://www.span.io/utilities).

**Product implication:** Expect growth in panels/breakers/load controllers marketed as (1) electrification-ready, (2) DR/VPP-capable, and (3) safety/compliance-forward—becoming a foundation for whole-home energy orchestration.

---

### 4.5 Bidirectional EV charging becomes a centerpiece of the home energy system
Enphase’s IQ Bidirectional EV Charger whitepaper illustrates the direction:
- Supports **V2H/V2G**, with islanding via an “IQ Meter Collar,” enabling backup even **without solar or stationary batteries** initially [[66]](https://enphase.com/download/iq-bidirectional-ev-charger-whitepaper).  
- Emphasizes tariff-aware “AI Optimization,” power limiting to avoid panel upgrades, standards like **ISO 15118-20**, OCPP connectivity, and lists **IEEE 2030.5** for grid connectivity [[66]](https://enphase.com/download/iq-bidirectional-ev-charger-whitepaper).  
- Includes black start capability and revenue-grade metering aimed at utility program participation [[66]](https://enphase.com/download/iq-bidirectional-ev-charger-whitepaper).

**Product implication:** EVs become mobile batteries integrated into HEMS—driving demand for chargers that are not just “fast,” but *grid-aware, home-aware, and incentive-aware*.

---

### 4.6 Policy and interoperability initiatives reinforce the trend
- **US DOE/IRA consumer incentives** cover heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, battery storage, EV chargers, and even electric panel upgrades—subsidizing the electrified assets that smart energy management coordinates [[73]](https://www.energy.gov/save/home-upgrades).  
- **EU “Energy Smart Appliances” initiative** launched a voluntary interoperability Code of Conduct (April 2024) to define common demand flexibility semantics; it aims to surface appliance flexibility capabilities in **EPREL by 16/03/2026** and explicitly emphasizes cross-brand interoperability [[75]](https://energy-efficient-products.ec.europa.eu/product-list/smart-appliances_en).

**Product implication:** Regulatory and quasi-regulatory frameworks increasingly reward products that can (a) expose flexibility features and (b) interoperate in energy management contexts.

---

## 5) Security, privacy, safety, and regulation: constraints that are turning into differentiating features

### 5.1 Security labeling and minimum baselines are becoming market-access features
**United States (labeling):**
- The FCC established a voluntary IoT cybersecurity labeling program using the **U.S. Cyber Trust Mark** and QR-linked registry info such as support period and whether updates are automatic [[82]](https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark)[[83]](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/07/30/2024-14148/cybersecurity-labeling-for-internet-of-things)[[85]](https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/12-IoT-Cyber-Labeling-Slide-Deck_10-TCB_Oct_2024.16.2024.pdf). The FCC explicitly names eligible product examples including home security cameras, smart appliances, baby monitors, etc. [[82]](https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark).  

**United Kingdom (mandatory minimum requirements):**
- The UK PSTI regime (effective **29 April 2024**) mandates minimum security requirements such as **unique or user-definable passwords**, published vulnerability reporting channels, and published **minimum security update periods** [[90]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-product-security-and-telecommunications-infrastructure-product-security-regime).

**European Union (product cybersecurity obligations):**
- The EU **Cyber Resilience Act** entered into force **10 Dec 2024**, with reporting obligations applying from **11 Sep 2026** and main obligations from **11 Dec 2027** [[86]](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act).  
- The EU **RED cybersecurity delegated requirements** (as summarized by BSI) apply from **1 Aug 2025**, bringing into effect requirements around network protection, privacy/personal data safeguards, and fraud protection for classes of radio equipment [[89]](https://www.bsigroup.com/siteassets/pdf/en/products-and-services/bsi_radio_equipment_directive-cybersecurity_faq_flyer_a4_241014.pdf).

**Product implication:** “Security by design” is no longer a premium feature; it’s becoming a procurement requirement. Roadmaps will prioritize long support lifetimes, patchability, credential management, and documented security posture.

### 5.2 Video privacy and operational security are core to smart home trust
- EU guidance stresses purpose limitation and that generic “safety” justifications for video surveillance are insufficient; household exemption is narrow, especially if cameras capture public space [[95]](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_201903_video_devices_en_0.pdf).  
- The FTC’s Ring case highlights real enforcement risk from weak access controls and account security—alleging excessive employee/contractor access to private videos and inadequate protections against account takeover, resulting in settlements, deletion obligations, and mandated privacy/security programs [[97]](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2023113-ring-llc)[[98]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/ring-refunds).

**Product implication:** Camera and doorbell products will increasingly ship with:
- tighter default access controls and auditability,
- stronger account security (e.g., MFA as default),
- privacy-forward modes (local processing options where feasible; explicit retention controls; “who accessed what” transparency),
- and clearer “field of view” / purpose disclosures in setup UX.

---

### 5.3 Baseline security standards are shaping feature checklists
ETSI EN 303 645 (widely referenced as a baseline) enumerates outcome-oriented provisions like: no universal default passwords, vulnerability reporting, keep software updated, securely store sensitive parameters, communicate securely, minimize attack surface, ensure software integrity, resilience to outages, telemetry examination, user data deletion, and easy installation/maintenance [[91]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/03.01.03_60/en_303645v030103p.pdf).  

**Product implication:** Expect these to translate into concrete, consumer-visible features:
- “support until” dates in product pages and in-app,
- automatic security updates enabled by default,
- local operation fallbacks for critical functions (locks, alarms) to support outage resilience,
- and simplified secure setup that reduces misconfiguration risk.

- **Thread 1.4-ready border routers** and ecosystems that avoid mesh fragmentation via credential sharing [[25]](https://www.threadgroup.org/Portals/0/Documents/Thread_1.4_Features_White_Paper_September_2024.pdf).  
- **Devices designed for multi-admin from day one** (simple sharing across Apple/Google/Amazon/Samsung/Home Assistant environments) enabled by Enhanced Multi-Admin approaches [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).  
- **UX primitives that “just work” across apps**: standardized Scenes and command batching to reduce latency and improve synchronized actions [[21]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-3-specification-released/).

---

### Trend 3 (High impact + high likelihood): **AI-powered “intent interfaces” for control, automation, and home history**
**What it is:** Moving from “tap/command the device” to “state your goal,” with AI translating intent into device control, automations, and summaries.

**Why now:** Google is shipping Gemini-based automation creation and camera event search/summaries through Premium tiers [[50]](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15542305)[[52]](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15684131). Amazon is positioning Alexa+ as conversational, action-taking, and agentic [[37]](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence)[[44]](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-tech-generative-artificial-intelligence).

---

### Trend 4 (High impact + high likelihood): **Next-gen home security bundles (cameras + locks + sensing + services), with privacy/security as differentiators**
**What it is:** Security remains the strongest expansion path in the smart home, but growth increasingly depends on trust, privacy design, and compliance.

**Why now:** Security devices are >25% of shipments per IDC reporting [[2]](https://backendnews.net/idc-emerging-regions-to-boost-smart-home-market-growth-by-2025/), and consumer willingness to pay is relatively higher in security categories [[8]](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/smart-home-2024-the-demand-and-price-dynamics-shaping-the-market/). Meanwhile, privacy concerns are a top barrier [[8]](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/smart-home-2024-the-demand-and-price-dynamics-shaping-the-market/), and enforcement actions show tangible risk [[97]](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2023113-ring-llc)[[98]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/ring-refunds). Regulatory baselines are tightening (UK PSTI; EU RED cybersecurity; CRA timeline; US labeling) [[90]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-product-security-and-telecommunications-infrastructure-product-security-regime)[[89]](https://www.bsigroup.com/siteassets/pdf/en/products-and-services/bsi_radio_equipment_directive-cybersecurity_faq_flyer_a4_241014.pdf)[[86]](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act)[[82]](https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark).

**Trend-defining product types/features**
- **Camera/doorbell systems with AI summarization + search**, but with explicit privacy controls, secure-by-default accounts, and transparent retention/access policies [[50]](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15542305)[[95]](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_201903_video_devices_en_0.pdf).  
- **Smart locks with standardized phone credentialing**: Aliro is launching (Q1 2026 per reporting) to standardize tap-to-unlock (NFC) and hands-free (UWB/BLE) across platforms, expanding “digital keys” beyond single-ecosystem implementations [[36]](https://www.theverge.com/news/854091/aliro-smart-lock-standard-launches-2026-apple-uwb-nfc)[[35]](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/aliro/).  
- **“Trust signals” in product UX**: published minimum support periods, automatic security updates, vulnerability reporting channels, and potentially security labels (US Cyber Trust Mark) [[82]](https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark)[[90]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-product-security-and-telecommunications-infrastructure-product-security-regime).  
- **Local-first critical operation** (locks/alarms function during internet outages) aligned with resilience expectations in baseline security guidance [[91]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/03.01.03_60/en_303645v030103p.pdf).

---

### Trend 5 (Medium-high impact + high likelihood): **Ambient sensing and presence as a platform primitive**
**What it is:** Replacing brittle motion triggers with continuous presence/context that can drive comfort, security, and energy savings.

**Why now:** Matter 1.4 expands occupancy sensing modalities including radar/vision/ambient sensing [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/). Samsung and others are building “activity-aware” experiences [[39]](https://news.samsung.com/uk/samsung-expands-ai-for-all-vision-at-ces-2025-to-bring-ai-everyday-everywhere)[[42]](https://blog.smartthings.com/roundups/samsung-smartthings-introduces-new-ai-features-at-unpacked/). Commercial mmWave sensors demonstrate market demand for camera-free presence [[56]](https://us.aqara.com/products/presence-sensor-fp2).

**Trend-defining product types/features**
- **mmWave/radar presence sensors with room zoning** (multi-zone, multi-person) integrated into mainstream platforms [[56]](https://us.aqara.com/products/presence-sensor-fp2).  
- **Presence embedded into hubs/routers/displays** so homes gain sensing without more devices (enabled by Matter’s sensing direction and ecosystem investments) [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).  
- **Context-driven automations** (home/away, room-level occupancy, sleep detection) that also feed energy optimization (thermostat presets/schedules) [[22]](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/).

---

### Trend 6 (Medium impact + very high likelihood): **Security- and compliance-forward product engineering becomes a “table stakes” differentiator**
**What it is:** Longer support commitments, better default security, and compliance artifacts become part of product marketing and procurement.

**Why now:** UK PSTI mandates password/reporting/update-period disclosures now [[90]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-product-security-and-telecommunications-infrastructure-product-security-regime). EU RED cybersecurity requirements apply from Aug 2025 [[89]](https://www.bsigroup.com/siteassets/pdf/en/products-and-services/bsi_radio_equipment_directive-cybersecurity_faq_flyer_a4_241014.pdf). US labeling is rolling out with QR registry info including support periods and update behavior [[82]](https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark)[[85]](https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/12-IoT-Cyber-Labeling-Slide-Deck_10-TCB_Oct_2024.16.2024.pdf). ETSI baseline provisions align to product checklists [[91]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/03.01.03_60/en_303645v030103p.pdf).

**Trend-defining product types/features**
- **Visible support-lifecycle commitments** (“security updates until YYYY-MM-DD”) in retail listings and setup flows [[90]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-product-security-and-telecommunications-infrastructure-product-security-regime)[[82]](https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark).  
- **Automatic updates enabled by default** and “resilient to outage” modes for critical functions [[91]](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/03.01.03_60/en_303645v030103p.pdf).  
- **SBOM/HBOM transparency** begins to appear in enterprise channels and could trickle into consumer trust registries (explicitly referenced as a registry field in FCC program materials) [[85]](https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/12-IoT-Cyber-Labeling-Slide-Deck_10-TCB_Oct_2024.16.2024.pdf).
